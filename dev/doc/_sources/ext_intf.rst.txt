Command Line
============

The front end is invoked by a command of the form

   ``edgcpfe [``\ *options*\ ``]`` *ifile*

to compile the single input file *ifile*. If ``-`` (hyphen) is specified
for *ifile*, the front end reads from ``stdin``. [#f1]_  No particular
file name suffix is required on input files.

Command line options may be specified using either single character option
codes (e.g., ``-o``) or keyword options (e.g., ``--output``).  A single
character option specification consists of a hyphen followed by one or more
option characters (e.g., ``-Ab``).  If an option requires an argument, the
argument may immediately follow the option letter, or may be separated from the
option letter by white space.  A keyword option specification consists of two
hyphens followed by the option keyword (e.g., ``--strict``).  Keyword options
may be abbreviated by specifying as many of the leading characters of the
option name as are needed to uniquely identify an option name (for example, the
``--wchar_t_keyword`` option may be abbreviated as ``--wc``).  If an option
requires an argument, the argument may be separated from the keyword by white
space, or the keyword may be immediately followed by ``=``\ *argument*.  When
the second form is used there may not be any white space on either side of the
equals sign.

If the configuration flag ``COMPILE_MULTIPLE_SOURCE_FILES`` is defined as TRUE,
a list of files may appear for *ifile*.  If a list of files is specified,
options that specify a compilation output file (``--output``, ``--list``, and
``--xref``) may not be used, and the name of each source file is written to the
error output file as the compilation of that file begins.

When one of the preprocessing-only modes is specified (see below), the
``--output`` option can be used to specify the preprocessing output file.  If
``--output`` is not specified, preprocessing output is written to ``stdout``.
Preprocessing output has trigraphs and line splices processed (and thus they do
not appear in their original form).

When compilation (rather than just preprocessing) is done, the output (if any)
from the compilation is written to a file selected by the back end; see the
documentation of the back end for further information.  For versions of the
front end that generate an intermediate language file, the ``--output`` option
can be used to specify the IL output file.

The *options* are described in the following subsections (organized by
category).

Language Dialect Options
------------------------

The following options select among various C and C++ dialects.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--anachronisms``
       | ``--no_anachronisms``
     - | Enable or disable anachronisms in C++ mode.  The default for this
         option is specified by ``DEFAULT_ALLOW_ANACHRONISMS``.  This option is
         valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--c``
       | ``-m``
     - | Enable compilation of C rather than C++.
   * - | ``--c89``
     - | Enable the compilation of the C89 version of C.
   * - | ``--c99``
       | ``--no_c99``
     - | Enable or disable compilation of the C99 version of C.  In either
         case, C rather than C++ is compiled.
   * - | ``--c11``
     - | Enable language features added in the C11 standard.  This option
         cannot be combined with options enabling or requiring a C++ mode.
   * - | ``--c18``
       | ``--c17``
     - | Enable support for C18 (which is only a minor "bug fix" change from
         C11).  This option cannot be combined with options enabling or
         requiring a C++ mode.
   * - | ``--c23``
     - | Enable language features added in drafts of the anticipated C23
         standard.  This option cannot be combined with options enabling or
         requiring a C++ mode.
   * - | ``--old_c``
       | ``-K``
     - | Enable K&R/pcc mode, which approximates the behavior of the standard
         UNIX ``pcc``.  ANSI/ISO C features that do not conflict with K&R/pcc
         features are still supported in this mode.
   * - | ``--c++``
       | ``-p``
     - | Enable compilation of C++. This is the default.
   * - | ``--c++03``
     - | Enable compilation of C++ as specified by the ISO/IEC 14882:2003
         standard by explicitly disabling all C++11 features, regardless of
         their configured default values (but individual C++11 features can be
         enabled on the command line).  This option implicitly enables C++ mode
         and can be combined with the options enabling strict ANSI/ISO
         conformance, as well as other emulation modes (e.g., ``--microsoft``,
         ``--g++``).
   * - | ``--c++11``
       | ``--no_c++11``
       | ``--c++0x``
       | ``--no_c++0x``
     - | Enable or disable extensions added in the C++11 standard.  This option
         is only valid in C++ mode and can be combined with the options
         enabling strict ANSI/ISO conformance.
   * - | ``--c++14``
     - | Enable language features added in the C++14 standard.  This option
         cannot be combined with options enabling or requiring a C mode.
   * - | ``--c++17``
     - | Enable language features added in the C++17 standard.  This option
         cannot be combined with options enabling or requiring a C mode.
   * - | ``--c++20``
     - | Enable language features added in the C++20 standard.  This option
         cannot be combined with options enabling or requiring a C mode.
   * - | ``--c++23``
     - | Enable language features added in the C++23 standard.  This option
         cannot be combined with options enabling or requiring a C mode.
   * - | ``--c++26``
     - | Enable language features added in drafts of the anticipated C++26
         standard.  This option cannot be combined with options enabling or
         requiring a C mode.
   * - | ``--cfront_2.1``
       | ``-b``
     - | Enable compilation of C++ with compatibility with cfront version 2.1.
         This causes the compiler to accept language constructs that, while not
         part of the C++ language definition, are accepted by the AT&T C++
         Language System (cfront) release 2.1.  This option also enables
         acceptance of anachronisms.
   * - | ``--cfront_3.0``
     - | Enable compilation of C++ with compatibility with cfront version 3.0.
         This causes the compiler to accept language constructs that, while not
         part of the C++ language definition, are accepted by the AT&T C++
         Language System (cfront) release 3.0.  This option also enables
         acceptance of anachronisms.
   * - | ``--c++cli``
       | ``--no_c++cli``
       | ``--cppcli``
       | ``--no_cppcli``
       | ``--clr``
     - | Enable or disable compilation of C++/CLI source.  This option implies
         Microsoft C++ mode; it cannot be combined with options that are
         contrary to such a mode (e.g., forcing strict mode) or with the option
         ``--microsoft_version`` with a value less than 1600.
   * - | ``--c++cx``
       | ``--no_c++cx``
       | ``--cppcx``
       | ``--no_cppcx``
     - | Enable or disable compilation of C++/CX source.  This option implies
         Microsoft C++ mode; it cannot be combined with options that are
         contrary to such a mode (e.g., forcing strict mode) or with the option
         ``--microsoft_version`` with a value less than 1600.  Support for this
         mode is preliminary and will be improved in future versions of the
         front end.
   * - | ``--clang``
       | ``--no_clang``
     - | Enable or disable clang C or C++ language compatibility features.
         This option also enables the GNU C or C++ language compatibility
         features.  It is only recognized when ``GNU_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` is
         TRUE.  As of this writing, the only effect of clang mode apart from
         enabling GNU emulation is to enable the feature-test macros like
         ``__has_feature``.
   * - | ``--clang_version`` *version-number*
       |
     - | The version of the clang compiler that should be emulated.  Version
         x.y.z of the clang compiler is encoded as x*10000+y*100+z (e.g.,
         version 3.4.1 is emulated with the option "``--clang_version
         30401``").
   * - | ``--embedded_c``
       | ``--no_embedded_c``
     - | Enable or disable support for all Embedded C language extensions
         (fixed-point types, named address space qualifiers, and named-register
         storage class specifiers).  These options are not available with C++
         modes.
   * - | ``--embedded_c++``
     - | Enable the diagnosis of noncompliance with the "Embedded C++" subset
         (from which templates, exceptions, namespaces, new-style casts, RTTI,
         multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, and ``mutable`` are
         excluded).
   * - | ``--g++``
       | ``--no_g++``
     - | Enable or disable GNU C++ language compatibility features.  This
         option also specifies that the source language being compiled is C++.
         It is only recognized when ``GNU_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--gcc``
       | ``--no_gcc``
     - | Enable or disable GNU C language compatibility features.  This option
         also specifies that the source language being compiled is C.  It is
         only recognized when ``GNU_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--gnu_version`` *version-number*
       |
     - | The version of the GNU compiler that should be emulated in any of the
         GNU (C or C++) modes.  Version x.y.z of the GNU compiler is encoded as
         x*10000+y*100+z (e.g., version 3.4.1 is emulated with the option
         "``--gnu_version 30401``").
   * - | ``--microsoft``
       | ``--microsoft_16``
       | ``--no_microsoft``
     - | Enable or disable Microsoft emulation mode.  These options may only be
         used if ``MICROSOFT_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE.  ``--microsoft``
         enables 32-bit mode.  ``--microsoft_16`` enables 16-bit mode (i.e.,
         support for ``near`` and ``far``; the option is accepted only if
         ``NEAR_AND_FAR_ALLOWED`` is TRUE).  The default values are supplied by
         ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_MODE`` and ``DEFAULT_NEAR_AND_FAR_ENABLED``.  In
         Microsoft emulation mode, language features that are not recognized by
         the Microsoft compiler are disabled by default.  In most cases these
         features can then be enabled through use of other command line options
         (for example, ``--bool``).  Microsoft bugs mode is also enabled when
         ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_BUGS`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--microsoft_version`` *version-number*
     - | The version of the Microsoft compiler that should be emulated in
         Microsoft mode.  This enables or disables particular Microsoft mode
         features when the acceptance of those features varies between versions
         of the Microsoft compiler.  The value specified is the value of the
         predefined macro ``_MSC_VER`` supplied by the version of the Microsoft
         compiler to be emulated.  For example, 1100 is the value that
         corresponds to Visual C++ version 5.0.  This option also enables
         Microsoft mode, but it does not imply either 16-bit or 32-bit mode
         (i.e., it uses whatever value has already been specified, or the
         default value if none has been explicitly specified).
   * - | ``--microsoft_build_number`` *build-number*
     - | The "build number" of the Microsoft compiler that should be emulated
         in Microsoft mode (this option also enables Microsoft mode).  This
         value is used to set the value of the predeclared macro
         ``_MSC_FULL_VER`` (which is a concatenation of the microsoft version
         number and the build number; e.g.,  with "``--microsoft_version 1600
         --microsoft_build_number 30507``" ``_MSC_FULL_VER`` is defined to
         expand to ``160030507``).  The default build number is 99999.
   * - | ``--microsoft_bugs``
       | ``--no_microsoft_bugs``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of certain Microsoft bugs.  These
         options also enable Microsoft mode.  Microsoft bugs mode is
         automatically enabled when Microsoft mode is used and
         ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_BUGS`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--ms_await``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/await`` command-line switch
         that enables a pre-C++20 version of coroutines.
   * - | ``--ms_await_strict``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/await:strict`` command-line
         switch that enables a pre-C++20 version of coroutines.
   * - | ``--ms_c11``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c11`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C11 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1927 for this
         option to have an effect.
   * - | ``--ms_c17``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c17`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C17 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1928 for this
         option to have an effect.
   * - | ``--ms_c23``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c23`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C23 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1935 for this
         option to have an effect.
   * - | ``--ms_c++14``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c++14`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C++14 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1903 to use this
         option.
   * - | ``--ms_c++17``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c++17`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C++17 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1911 to use this
         option.
   * - | ``--ms_c++20``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c++20`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C++20 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1920 to use this
         option.
   * - | ``--ms_c++23``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c++23`` command-line switch
         by enabling the same set of C++23 options that are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
         ``microsoft_version`` must have a value of at least 1943 to use this
         option.
   * - | ``--ms_c++latest``
     - | Emulate the Microsoft Visual Studio ``/std:c++latest`` command-line
         switch by enabling the same set of C++ options as are supported by the
         Visual Studio version that corresponds to the value of
         ``microsoft_version``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
   * - | ``--ms_compatibility``
       | ``--no_ms_compatibility``
     - | Enable or disable certain Microsoft compatibility options (as defined
         by the ``clang``\ ``-fms-compatibility`` option).  Unlike the
         ``--microsoft`` option (i.e., Microsoft emulation mode), this
         command-line option can be combined with other emulation modes (e.g.,
         ``--clang``).  Specifying ``--ms_compatibility`` implies
         ``--ms_extensions``.  If not specified explicitly with the
         ``--microsoft_version`` command-line option, ``microsoft_version`` is
         set to the value of the ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
   * - | ``--ms_std_preprocessor``
       | ``--no_ms_std_preprocessor``
     - | Enable or disable a mode in which the behavior of the preprocessor in
         Microsoft emulation mode conforms with the C and C++ Standards; when
         disabled, the preprocessor emulates the behavior of the traditional
         Microsoft preprocessor.
   * - | ``--ms_stdc``
       | ``--no_ms_stdc``
     - | Emulate the ``/Zc:__STDC__`` option of Microsoft's Visual Studio by
         setting the value of the ``__STDC__`` macro to the value ``1`` or
         leaving the macro undefined respectively.  Implicitly enables
         Microsoft emulation mode.
   * - | ``--ms_cplusplus_std_value``
       | ``--no_ms_cplusplus_std_value``
       |
     - | Emulate the ``/Zc:__cplusplus[-]`` option of Microsoft's Visual Studio
         by either setting the value of the ``__cplusplus`` macro to the value
         implied by the C++ standard currently being implemented or leaving it
         as the default value of ``199711L`` used by Visual Studio.  Implicitly
         enables Microsoft emulation mode.
   * - | ``--ms_extensions``
       | ``--no_ms_extensions``
     - | Enable or disable certain Microsoft extensions (as defined by the
         ``clang``\ ``-fms-extensions`` option).  Unlike the ``--microsoft``
         option (i.e., Microsoft emulation mode), this command-line option can
         be combined with other emulation modes (e.g., ``--clang``).  If not
         specified explicitly with the ``--microsoft_version`` command-line
         option, ``microsoft_version`` is set to the value of the
         ``DEFAULT_MICROSOFT_VERSION`` macro.
   * - | ``--ms_permissive``
       | ``--no_ms_permissive``
     - | Enable or disable "permissive" mode during Microsoft emulation.  These
         command-line options control emulation of the Visual Studio
         ``/permissive[-]`` command-line options and can be used in C, C++,
         C++/CLI, or C++/CX modes.  The default value is controlled by the
         ``DEFAULT_MS_PERMISSIVE`` configuration macro.  Specifying one of
         these command-line options also implicitly enables Microsoft emulation
         mode.
   * - | ``--nonstd_gnu_keywords``
       | ``--no_nonstd_gnu_keywords``
       |
     - | In GNU modes, ``--no_nonstd_gnu_keywords`` disables GNU-specific
         keywords that do not start with underscores (notably: ``typeof``); the
         option has no effect in other modes.  ``--nonstd_gnu_keywords`` is
         only accepted in GNU modes and enables any keywords that were disabled
         by a prior occurrence of ``--no_nonstd_gnu_keywords``.
   * - | ``--no_strict_gnu``
       | ``--strict_gnu``
     - | For every version of the C and C++ ISO standards, the GNU and Clang
         compilers support both the language as defined by ISO (with
         ``-std=c*`` command-line options) as well as the language with certain
         incompatible compiler-specific extensions (with ``-std=gnu*``).
         Specifying ``--strict_gnu`` on the command-line causes the front end
         to emulate the ``-std=c*`` behavior of the selected GNU/Clang
         compiler, while specifying ``--no_strict_gnu`` emulates the
         ``-std=gnu*`` behavior.  When these options are not specified, the
         front end implicitly emulates the ``-std=c*`` behavior whenever any
         ``--c*`` or ``--c++*`` command-line options are specified (e.g.,
         ``--c++11`` mimics ``-std=c++11``); otherwise the ``-std=gnu*``
         behavior is emulated.
   * - | ``--strict_warnings`` or ``-a``
       | ``--strict`` or ``-A``
     - | Enable strict ANSI/ISO mode, which provides diagnostic messages when
         nonstandard features are used, and disables features that conflict
         with ANSI/ISO C or C++.  This is compatible with both C and C++ mode.
         It is not compatible with pcc mode.  ANSI/ISO violations can be issued
         as either warnings or errors depending on which command line option is
         used.  The ``-A`` and ``--strict`` options cause errors to be issued
         whereas the ``-a`` and ``--strict_warnings`` options produce warnings.
         (Note that nonstandard types, functions, etc., that might be
         predeclared by various compilers will not be declared by the front end
         in this mode, so any references to these names will be diagnosed as
         errors, regardless of which of these options is specified.) The error
         threshold is set so that the requested diagnostics will be listed.
   * - | ``--stricter_template_checking``
     - | If a selected dialect weakens the type checking performed in a
         template, adding this option makes it stricter again (although not
         always as strict as what is done in strict ANSI/ISO mode).
   * - | ``--sun``
       | ``--no_sun``
     - | Enable or disable Sun CC (version 5.x) language compatibility
         features.  This option can only be used in C++ mode, and cannot be
         combined with options to enable strict ANSI mode, or compatibility
         with cfront, Microsoft, or GNU.  It is only recognized when
         ``SUN_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--svr4``
       | ``--no_svr4``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of SVR4 C compatibility features.  The
         default value is supplied by ``DEFAULT_SVR4_C_MODE``.  This option
         also specifies that the source language being compiled is ANSI C.
   * - | ``--upc``
       | ``--no_upc``
     - | Enable or disable UPC (Unified Parallel C) extensions.
   * - | ``--upc_threads`` *n*
     - | Specify a fixed number of UPC threads (this is the value of the
         THREADS identifier).
   * - | ``--upc_strict``
       | ``--upc_relaxed``
     - | Specify the default UPC access method for objects of shared types.

Input/output Options
--------------------

The following options control the kind of input read or output produced or the
location of such input or output.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--unicode_source_kind`` *kind*
       |
     - | Source input files that do not begin with a byte order mark indicating
         the kind of Unicode encoding are assumed to use the Unicode encoding
         indicated by *kind*.  Possible values of *kind* are ``UTF-8``,
         ``UTF-16``, ``UTF-16LE`` (little-endian), ``UTF-16BE`` (big-endian),
         and ``none`` (to indicate that the source file is not Unicode).
   * - | ``--gen_c_file_name`` *file-name*
       |
     - | When using the C-generating back end or the C++-generating back end,
         this option specifies the file name to be used for the generated
         output.
   * - | ``--dependencies``
       | ``-M``
     - | Do preprocessing only.  Instead of the normal preprocessing output,
         generate on the preprocessing output file a list of dependency lines
         suitable for input to the UNIX ``make`` program.  Note that when
         implicit inclusion of templates is enabled, the output may indicate
         false (but safe) dependencies unless ``--no_preproc_only`` is also
         used.
   * - | ``--error_output`` *efile*
     - | Redirect the output that would normally go to the error output
         file (i.e., diagnostic messages) to the file *efile*.  This option
         is useful on systems where output redirection of files is not well
         supported.  If used, this option should probably be specified
         first in the command line, since otherwise any command-line errors
         for options preceding the ``--error_output`` would be written to
         ``stderr`` before redirection.
   * - | ``--list`` *lfile*
       | ``-L``\ *lfile*
     - | Generate raw listing information in the file *lfile*.  This
         information is likely to be used to generate a formatted listing.
         The raw listing file contains raw source lines, information on
         transitions into and out of include files, and diagnostics
         generated by the front end.  Each line of the listing file begins
         with a key character that identifies the type of line, as follows:

       ``N``:
          a normal line of source; the rest of the line is the text of the
          line.

       ``X``:
          the expanded form of a normal line of source; the rest of the
          line is the text of the line. This line appears following the N
          line, and only if the line contains non-trivial modifications
          (comments are considered trivial modifications; macro expansions,
          line splices, and trigraphs are considered non-trivial
          modifications). Comments are replaced by a single space in the
          expanded-form line.

       ``S``:
          a line of source skipped by an #if or the like; the rest of the
          line is text. Note that the #else, #elif, or #endif that ends a
          skip is marked with an N.

       ``L``:
          an indication of a change in source position. The line has a
          format similar to the # line-identifying directive output by cpp,
          that is to say

              ``L`` *line-number* ``"``\ *file-name*\ ``"`` *key*

          where *key* is 1 for entry into an include file, 2 for exit from an
          include file, and omitted otherwise. The first line in the raw
          listing file is always an L line identifying the primary input
          file. L lines are also output for #line directives (*key* is
          omitted). L lines indicate the source position of the following
          source line in the raw listing file.

       ``R``, ``W``, ``E``, or ``C``:
          an indication of a diagnostic (``R`` for remark, ``W`` for
          warning, ``E`` for error, and ``C`` for catastrophic error). The
          line has the form

              *S* ``"``\ *file-name*\ ``"`` *line-number column-number
              message-text*

          where *S* is ``R``, ``W``, ``E``, or ``C``, as explained
          above. Errors at the end of file indicate the last line of the
          primary source file and a column number of zero. Command-line
          errors are catastrophes with an empty file name (``""``) and a
          line and column number of zero. Internal errors are catastrophes
          with position information as usual, and message-text beginning
          with (internal error).  When a diagnostic displays a list (e.g.,
          all the contending routines when there is ambiguity on an
          overloaded call), the initial diagnostic line is followed by one
          or more lines with the same overall format (code letter, file
          name, line number, column number, and message text), but in which
          the code letter is the lower case version of the code letter in
          the initial line. The source position in such lines is the same
          as that in the corresponding initial line.

   * - | ``--list_macros``
     - | Do preprocessing only.  Instead of the normal preprocessing output,
         generate on the preprocessing output file a list of all the macros in
         effect after processing the source file, including predefined and
         command-line macros along with their definitions.
   * - | ``--no_line_commands``
       | ``-P``
     - | Do preprocessing only.  Write preprocessed text to the preprocessing
         output file, with comments removed and without line control
         information.
   * - | ``--old_line_commands``
     - | When generating source output (e.g., with the C-generating back end),
         put out ``#line`` directives in the form used by the Reiser cpp, i.e.,
         "``#`` *nnn*" instead of "``#line`` *nnn*".
   * - | ``--output`` *ofile*
       | ``-o`` *ofile*
     - | Specify the output file of the compilation, i.e., the preprocessing or
         intermediate language output file.
   * - | ``--xref`` *xfile*
       | ``-X``\ *xfile*
     - | Generate cross-reference information in the file *xfile*.  For each
         reference to an identifier in the source program, a line of the form

            *symbol-id name ref-code file-name line-number column-number*

       | is written, where *ref-code* is ``D`` for definition, ``d`` for
         declaration (that is, a declaration that is not a definition), ``T``
         for a full template instantiation, ``t`` for a partial template
         instantiation (i.e., an instantiation of the template declaration, but
         not of its definition), ``M`` for modification, ``A`` for address
         taken, ``U`` for used, ``C`` for changed (but actually meaning "used
         and modified in a single operation," such as an increment), ``R`` for
         any other kind of reference, or ``E`` for an error in which the kind
         of reference is indeterminate.  *symbol-id* is a unique decimal number
         for the symbol.  The fields of the above line are separated by tab
         characters.
   * - | ``--create_header_unit`` *file*
     - | Write an EDG IFC header unit file
         representing the current translation unit to *file*.
   * - | ``--create_module_interface`` *file*
       |
     - | Write an EDG IFC module file for a module interface unit to *file*.
   * - | ``--create_module_internal_partition`` *file*
       |
     - | Write an EDG IFC module file for a module implementation unit to
         *file*.
   * - | ``--module_interface``
     - | Write an EDG IFC module file for a module interface unit in the
         current working directory.  The filename is derived from the parsed
         module declaration.
   * - | ``--module_internal_partition``
       |
     - | Write an EDG IFC module file for a module implementation unit in the
         current working directory.  The filename is derived from the parsed
         module declaration.

Preprocessor Options
--------------------

The following options control the behavior of the preprocessor.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--comments``
       | ``-C``
     - | Keep comments in the preprocessed output.  This should be specified
         after either ``--preprocess`` or ``--no_line_commands``; it does not
         of itself request preprocessing output.
   * - | ``--define_macro`` *name* [ ``(`` *parm-list* ``)`` ] [ = *def* ]
       | ``-D`` *name* [ ``(`` *parm-list* ``)`` ] [ ``=`` *def* ]
       |
     - | Define macro *name* as *def*.  If "``=`` *def* " is omitted,
         define *name* as ``1``.  Function-style macros can be defined by
         appending a macro parameter list to *name*.
   * - | ``--embed_directory`` *dir*
     - | Add *dir* to the list of directories searched for ``#embed``\ s.  The
         process by which files named in #embed directives are found is similar
         to that used for ``#include``.  See :ref:`finding-includes`.
   * - | ``--import_dir`` *dir-name*
     - | Specify the directory in which the files to be included by ``#import``
         directives are to be found.  These files must have been generated
         previously by the Microsoft compiler.  This option is valid only in
         Microsoft mode.
   * - | ``--incl_suffixes`` *str*
     - | Specifies the list of suffixes to be used when searching for an
         include file whose name was specified without a suffix.  The
         argument is a colon-separated list of suffixes (e.g.,
         ``"h:hpp::"``).  If a null suffix is to be allowed, it must be
         included in the suffix list.  The default is specified by the
         configuation flag ``DEFAULT_INCLUDE_FILE_SUFFIX_LIST``.
   * - | ``--include_directory`` *dir*
       | ``--sys_include`` *dir*
       | ``-I``\ *dir*
     - | Add *dir* to the list of directories searched for ``#include``\ s.
         See :ref:`finding-includes`.
   * - | ``--modules_directory`` *dir*
       |
     - | Add *dir* to the list of directories searched for module files when
         processing an ``import`` directive.  The current working directory is
         automatically added to the start of this list.  If the
         ``EDG_MODULES_PATH`` environment variable is set, that path is added
         to the end of the list.  See :ref:`finding-modules`.
   * - | ``--ms_header_unit`` *header_path*\ ``=``\ *module_file*
       | ``--header_unit`` *header_path*\ ``=``\ *module_file*
       |
     - | Add *module_file* to the header unit map, corresponding to
         *header_path*.  When importing a header unit, if the resolved path
         to the header matches *header_path*, then *module_file* is used as
         the match.  See :ref:`finding-modules`.
   * - | ``--ms_header_unit_angle`` *header_path*\ ``=``\ *module_file*
       | ``--ms_header_unit_quote`` *header_path*\ ``=``\ *module_file*
       |
     - | Add *module_file*, corresponding to *header_path*, to a header
         unit map selected by the form in which *header_path* is written,
         ``<...>`` and ``"..."``, respectively.  Unlike --ms_header_unit,
         *header_path* is not resolved immediately but will be resolved on
         demand.  (See :ref:`finding-includes`.) If the resolved path to
         the header for the header unit matches the resolved *header_path*,
         *module_file* is used as the match.  See :ref:`finding-modules`.
   * - | ``--ms_mod_file_map`` [ *module_name*\ ``=`` ] *file*
       |
     - | If *module_name* is omitted, *file* will be examined to determine
         if the module it represents matches the module named in the
         ``import`` directive.  Otherwise, an import of *module_name* will
         resolve to *file* without examining its contents.  See
         :ref:`finding-modules`.
   * - | ``--ms_translate_include``
       | ``--no_ms_translate_include``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the automatic translation of ``#include``
         directives into ``import`` directives when a header has a mapping
         to a module file in a header unit map (see ``--ms_header_unit``,
         ``--ms_header_unit_angle``, and ``--ms_header_unit_quote``
         regarding how such mappings are specified.)
   * - | ``--old_style_preprocessing``
       |
     - | Forces pcc style preprocessing when compiling in ANSI C or C++ mode.
         This may be used when compiling an ANSI C or C++ program on a system
         in which the system header files require pcc style preprocessing.
   * - | ``--preinclude_macros`` *filename*
       | ``--preinclude`` *filename*
     - | Include the source code of the indicated file at the beginning of the
         compilation.  This can be used to establish standard macro
         definitions, etc.  The file name is searched for in the directories on
         the include search list.  When the ``preinclude_macros`` variant is
         used, only the preprocessing directives from the file are evaluated.
         All of the actual code is discarded.  The effect of this option is
         that any macro definitions from the specified file will be in effect
         when the primary source file is compiled.  All of the macro-only files
         are processed before any of the normal preincludes.  Within each
         group, the files are processed in the order in which they were
         specified.
   * - | ``--preprocess``
       | ``-E``
     - | Do preprocessing only.  Write preprocessed text to the preprocessing
         output file, with comments removed and with line control information.
   * - | ``--no_preproc_only``
     - | May be used in conjunction with the options that normally cause the
         front end to do preprocessing only (e.g., ``--preprocess``, etc.) to
         specify that a full compilation should be done (not just
         preprocessing).  When used with the implicit inclusion option, this
         makes it possible to generate a preprocessed output file that includes
         any implicitly included files.
   * - | ``--stdc_zero_in_system_headers``
       | ``--no_stdc_zero_in_system_headers``
       |
     - | Enable or disable special processing of the ``__STDC__`` macro
         when referenced from system headers.  When this feature is
         enabled, ``__STDC__`` has the value zero in system header files
         (files found in directories specified using the ``--sys_include``
         option) and one otherwise.  This feature is provided to emulate
         the behavior of ``gcc`` in certain configurations.  The default is
         specified by ``DEFAULT_STDC_ZERO_IN_SYSTEM_HEADERS``.  If the flag
         is not TRUE by default, the GNU mode default is specified by the
         ``DEFAULT_GNU_STDC_ZERO_IN_SYSTEM_HEADERS`` macro.
   * - | ``--trace_includes``
       | ``-H``
     - | Output a list of the names of files ``#include``\ d to the error
         output file.  The source file is compiled normally (i.e., it is not
         just preprocessed) unless another option that causes preprocessing
         only is specified.
   * - | ``--undefine_macro`` *name*
       | ``-U``\ *name*
     - | Remove any initial definition of the macro *name*.
         ``--undefine_macro`` options are processed after all
         ``--define_macro`` options in the command line have been
         processed.
   * - | ``--check_concatenations``
       | ``--no_check_concatenations``
       |
     - | Specifies whether or not the front end will issue a diagnostic if a
         concatenation operator ``##`` in a macro expansion fails to produce a
         valid preprocessor token as required by the C and C++ Standards.
   * - | ``--no_token_separators_in_pp_output``
       |
     - | Used in connection with options that generate preprocessing output,
         suppresses the extra spaces the front end inserts in the text of macro
         expansions to ensure that tokens that should not be combined remain
         separate tokens.  This can be used to prevent the insertion of
         extraneous spaces when the front end is used as a preprocessor for
         text that is not C or C++.

Diagnostic Options
------------------

The following options control when or how diagnostics are emitted.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--add_match_notes``
       | ``--no_add_match_notes``
     - | Enable or disable diagnostic notes that
         provide further details for a failure to match candidates in an
         overload set.
   * - | ``--brief_diagnostics``
       | ``--no_brief_diagnostics``
       |
     - | Enable or disable a mode in which a shorter form of the diagnostic
         output is used.  When enabled, the original source line is not
         displayed and the error message text is not wrapped when too long to
         fit on a single line.
   * - | ``--colors``
       | ``--no_colors``
     - | Enable or disable colorization of diagnostic messages.  The default
         behavior is controlled by the ``DEFAULT_ENABLE_COLORIZED_DIAGNOSTICS``
         configuration macro (which defaults to TRUE).  Colorized
         diagnostics are disabled when not writing to a terminal, and are also
         disabled when the ``NOCOLOR`` environment variable is set, the
         ``TERM`` environment variable is unset, or the ``EDG_COLORS``
         environment variable is set to an empty string.
   * - | ``--constexpr_diag_suppress`` *tag, tag,...*
       | ``--constexpr_diag_remark`` *tag, tag,...*
       | ``--constexpr_diag_warning`` *tag, tag,...*
       | ``--constexpr_diag_error`` *tag, tag,...*
     - | Override the severity of the diagnostics that calls of
         ``__builtin_constexpr_diag`` request with any of the specified tags.
         A tag is shown in brackets at the end of the diagnostic it names, and
         may contain only letters, digits, and underscores.  When more than
         one of these options names a given tag, the last one on the command
         line takes effect.
   * - | ``--context_limit`` *number*
       |
     - | Set the context limit to *number*.  The context limit is the maximum
         number of template instantiation context entries to be displayed as
         part of a diagnostic message.  The default is specified by the
         ``DEFAULT_CONTEXT_LIMIT`` macro.  If the number of context entries
         exceeds the limit, the first and last N context entries are displayed,
         where N is half of the context limit.  A value of zero is used to
         indicate that there is no limit.
   * - | ``--diag_suppress`` *tag, tag,...*
       | ``--diag_remark`` *tag, tag,...*
       | ``--diag_warning`` *tag, tag,...*
       | ``--diag_error`` *tag, tag,...*
     - | Override the normal error severity of the specified diagnostic
         messages.  The message(s) may be specified using a mnemonic error tag
         or using an error number.  The error tag names and error numbers are
         listed in the Error Messages appendix.
   * - | ``--diag_once`` *tag, tag,...*
     - | Causes the specified diagnostic to be issued only once as a warning or
         remark.  The message(s) may be specified using a mnemonic error tag or
         using an error number.  The error tag names and error numbers are
         listed in the Error Messages appendix.
   * - | ``--display_error_number``
       | ``--no_display_error_number``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the display of an error message number in any
         diagnostic messages that are generated.  The option may be used to
         determine the error number to be used when overriding the severity of
         a diagnostic message.  The configuration macro
         ``DEFAULT_DISPLAY_ERROR_NUMBER`` specifies the default behavior.
   * - | ``--error_limit`` *number*
       | ``-e`` *number*
     - | Set the error limit to *number*.  The front end will abandon
         compilation after this number of errors (remarks and warnings are
         not counted toward the limit).  By default, the limit is 100.
   * - | ``--for_init_diff_warning``
       | ``--no_for_init_diff_warning``
       |
     - | Enable or disable a warning that is issued when programs compiled
         under the new for-init scoping rules would have had different behavior
         under the old rules.  The diagnostic is only put out when the new
         rules are used.  ``DEFAULT_WARNING_ON_FOR_INIT_DIFFERENCE`` specifies
         the default behavior.  This option is valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--lossy_conversion_warning``
       | ``--no_lossy_conversion_warning``
       |
     - | Enable or disable a warning that is issued when conversion of an
         arithmetic value to a different type might result in lost data because
         the target type cannot represent all the values of the source type.
   * - | ``--macro_positions_in_diagnostics``
       | ``--no_macro_positions_in_diagnostics``
       |
     - | Enable or disable display of extra information for diagnostics that
         refer to text in macro expansions.  These options may only be used if
         ``FULLY_RESOLVED_MACRO_POSITIONS`` is TRUE.  The additional
         information includes the original source line from which the text
         identified by the message was copied into the macro expansion (i.e., a
         macro definition or an argument in the top-level macro invocation), as
         well as the chain of macro invocations that led to the expanded text
         designated by the diagnostic (if ``MACRO_INVOCATION_TREE_IN_IL`` is
         TRUE).  The default value is given by
         ``DEFAULT_MACRO_POSITIONS_IN_DIAGNOSTICS``.
   * - | ``--module_import_diagnostics``
       | ``--no_module_import_diagnostics``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the issuing of diagnostics while importing entities
         from module files.
   * - | ``--output_mode`` *mode*
     - | Set the front end diagnostic output mode to *mode*.  Valid modes
         are ``text`` for traditional command line diagnostic output and
         ``sarif`` for SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)
         output (see `www.sarif.info <https://www.sarif.info>`__).
   * - | ``--promote_warnings``
       | ``-W``
     - | Issue all warnings as if they were discretionary errors.``
   * - | ``--remarks``
       | ``-r``
     - | Issue remarks, which are diagnostic messages even milder than
         warnings.
   * - | ``--report_gnu_extensions``
       |
     - | Warn about the use of certain GNU extensions outside system header
         files.  Only valid in GNU C or C++ mode.
   * - | ``--template_typedefs_in_diagnostics``
       | ``--no_template_typedefs_in_diagnostics``
       |
     - | Disable or enable, respectively, the replacement of typedefs
         declared in template classes with their underlying type.
         Diagnostic messages are often more useful when such typedefs are
         replaced.  The default behavior is specified by the
         ``DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS_IN_DIAGNOSTICS`` macro.
   * - | ``--timing``
       | ``-#``
     - | Generate compilation timing information.  This option causes the
         compiler to display the amount of CPU time and elapsed time used by
         each phase of the compilation and a total for the entire compilation.
   * - | ``--top_templates`` *number*
     - | At the end of the compilation, write to the error output file a report
         of the templates that were substituted the most.  *number* specifies
         how many templates to report; if it is zero, every template that has a
         nonzero number of substitutions is reported.
   * - | ``--no_use_before_set_warnings``
       | ``-j``
     - | Suppress warnings on local automatic variables that are used before
         their values are set.  The front end's algorithm for detecting such
         uses is conservative and is likely to miss some cases that an
         optimizer with sophisticated flow analysis could detect; thus, an
         implementation might choose to suppress the warnings from the front
         end when optimization has been requested but to permit them when the
         optimizer is not being run.
   * - | ``--no_warnings``
       | ``-w``
     - | Suppress warnings.  Errors are still issued.
   * - | ``--wrap_diagnostics``
       | ``--no_wrap_diagnostics``
     - | Enable or disable a mode in which the error message text is not
         wrapped when too long to fit on a single line.

Individual Language Features
----------------------------

The following options enable or disable specific language syntax.  (Options
that affect the meaning of existing constructs are listed in
:ref:`cli-alt-lang-behaviors`.)

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--alternative_tokens``
       | ``--no_alternative_tokens``
       |
     - | Enable or disable recognition of alternative tokens.  This controls
         recognition of the digraph tokens in C and C++, and controls
         recognition of the operator keywords (e.g., ``and``, ``bitand``, etc.)
         in C++.  The default behavior is specified by the
         ``DEFAULT_ALTERNATIVE_TOKENS_ALLOWED`` configuration constant.
   * - | ``--array_new_and_delete``
       | ``--no_array_new_and_delete``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for array new and delete.  The default
         behavior is specified by the configuration constant
         ``DEFAULT_ARRAY_NEW_AND_DELETE_ENABLED``.  This option is valid only
         in C++ mode.  The front end can be configured to define a
         preprocessing variable when array new and delete are enabled.  This
         preprocessing variable may then be used by the standard header files
         to decide whether to include the declarations for the array new/delete
         functions.
   * - | ``--auto_storage``
       | ``--no_auto_storage``
     - | Enable or disable the traditional meaning of ``auto`` as a storage
         class specifier (only valid in C++ mode).  (If disabled, then ``auto``
         must be a type specifier.).  The default behavior is specified by the
         ``DEFAULT_AUTO_STORAGE_CLASS_SPECIFIER_ENABLED`` configuration
         constant.
   * - | ``--auto_type``
       | ``--no_auto_type``
     - | Enable or disable ``auto`` as a type specifier where the actual type
         is deduced from an initializer (only valid in C++ mode).  This is a
         C++11 feature.  If enabled, the traditional meaning of ``auto`` as a
         storage class specifier is disabled (which matches C++11), unless the
         option ``--auto_storage`` is also supplied.  The default behavior is
         specified by the ``DEFAULT_AUTO_TYPE_SPECIFIER_ENABLED`` configuration
         constant.
   * - | ``--bit_precise_integers``
       | ``--no_bit_precise_integers``
     - | Enable or disable support for C23-style ``_BitInt`` types.
   * - | ``--bool``
       | ``--no_bool``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of ``bool``.  The default value is
         supplied by ``DEFAULT_BOOL_IS_KEYWORD``.  This option is valid only in
         C++ mode.  The front end can be configured to define a preprocessing
         variable when ``bool`` is recognized.  This preprocessing variable may
         then be used by header files to determine whether a typedef should be
         supplied to define ``bool``.
   * - | ``--c23_typeof``
       | ``--no_c23_typeof``
     - | Enable or disable support for the C23 ``typeof`` and
         ``typeof_unqual`` operators, regardless of the current C language
         level.  This option is valid only in C mode.
   * - | ``--c++11_sfinae``
       | ``--no_c++11_sfinae``
     - | Enable or disable template deduction in the style dictated by the
         C++11 standard, i.e., where general expressions are allowed in
         deduction contexts and they undergo the full usual semantic
         checking.  This type of deduction is necessary to get the full
         power of the ``decltype`` feature in return types.  ("SFINAE" is
         an acronym for "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error", which is
         the guiding principle for template deduction, and by extension a
         name for the process of deduction.)
   * - | ``--c++11_sfinae_ignore_access``
       | ``--no_c++11_sfinae_ignore_access``
       |
     - | When new-style SFINAE is enabled, these options control whether or not
         access errors cause deduction failures.  The positive option indicates
         that access checking should not be done during template deduction, and
         therefore that access errors cannot cause a deduction failure; this
         was the status quo ante when the new-style SFINAE rules were proposed.
         The "``no``" version of the option indicates that access checking
         should be done during template deduction, and therefore that access
         errors cause a deduction failure; this is the revised direction chosen
         by the standards committee.
   * - | ``--char8_t``
       | ``--no_char8_t``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for the ``char8_t`` keyword and type (a
         C++20 feature).  Enabled by default in C++20 mode.
   * - | ``--compound_literals``
       | ``--no_compound_literals``
     - | Enable or disable support for "compound literals" (a C99 feature).
   * - | ``--concepts``
       | ``--no_concepts``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for concepts (a C++20 feature).
   * - | ``--delegating_constructors``
       | ``--no_delegating_constructors``
       |
     - | Enable or disable delegating constructors (a C++11 feature).
   * - | ``--deprecated_string_conv``
       | ``--no_deprecated_string_conv``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the deprecated conversion from a string literal to
         ``char *``.  Meaningful only when string literals are const.
   * - | ``--designators``
       | ``--no_designators``
     - | Enable or disable support for designators (a C99 feature).  These
         options are not available in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--digit_separators``
       | ``--no_digit_separators``
     - | Enable or disable support for digit separators (a C++14 feature).
         When this feature is enabled, an apostrophe can appear between the
         digits of a numeric literal and is ignored, e.g., ``123'456'789``.
   * - | ``--extended_designators``
       | ``--no_extended_designators``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for "extended designators," an extension
         accepted only in C mode to emulate the behavior of certain other C
         compilers when it comes to designators in aggregate initializers.
   * - | ``--dollar``
       | ``-$``
     - | Accept dollar signs in identifiers.  The default value of this option
         is specified in a configuration file.
   * - | ``--exceptions--no_exceptions``
       | ``-x``
     - | Enable or disable support for exception handling.  ``-x`` is
         equivalent to ``--exceptions``.  The default behavior is specified by
         the configuration constant ``DEFAULT_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED``.  This
         option is valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--exc_spec_in_func_type``
       | ``--no_exc_spec_in_func_type``
     - | Enable or disable exceptions being part of a function type (enabled by
         default in C++17 modes and disabled by default otherwise).
   * - | ``--explicit``
       | ``--no_explicit``
     - | Enable or disable support for the ``explicit`` specifier on
         constructor declarations.  The default behavior is specified by the
         configuration constant ``DEFAULT_EXPLICIT_KEYWORD_ENABLED``.  This
         option is valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--export``
       | ``--no_export``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of exported templates.  The default
         value is supplied by ``DEFAULT_EXPORT_TEMPLATE_ALLOWED``.  This option
         is valid only in C++ mode.  This option requires that dependent name
         processing be done, and cannot be used with implicit inclusion of
         template definitions.
   * - | ``--extern_inline``
       | ``--no_extern_inline``
     - | Enable or disable support for ``inline`` functions with external
         linkage in C++.  When ``inline`` functions are allowed to have
         external linkage (as required by the standard), then ``extern`` and
         ``inline`` are compatible specifiers on a nonmember function
         declaration; the default linkage when ``inline`` appears alone is
         external (that is, ``inline`` means ``extern inline`` on nonmember
         functions); and an ``inline`` member function takes on the linkage of
         its class (which is usually external).  However, when ``inline``
         functions have only internal linkage (as specified in the ARM), then
         ``extern`` and ``inline`` are incompatible; the default linkage when
         ``inline`` appears alone is internal (that is, ``inline`` means
         ``static inline`` on nonmember functions); and ``inline`` member
         functions have internal linkage no matter what the linkage of their
         class.
   * - | ``--fixed_point``
       | ``--no_fixed_point``
     - | Enable or disable support for Embedded C fixed-point types.  (Not
         available in C++ modes.)
   * - | ``--lambdas``
       | ``--no_lambdas``
     - | Enable or disable support for C++11 lambdas.  (Only available in C++
         modes.)
   * - | ``--long_long``
     - | Permit the use of ``long long`` in strict mode in dialects in which it
         is non-standard.
   * - | ``--modules``
       | ``--no_modules``
     - | Enable or disable support for modules.  Modules are currently
         experimental and will be enabled by default in future releases in the
         applicable modes.  The front end does not currently generate modules
         files of its own and can only consume module files produced by
         Microsoft Visual Studio version 16.8.  This support is incomplete and
         compatibility will change in future releases.
       |
   * - | ``--multibyte_chars``
       | ``--no_multibyte_chars``
     - | Enable or disable processing for multibyte character sequences in
         comments, string literals, and character constants.  The default
         behavior is specified by
         ``DEFAULT_MULTIBYTE_CHARS_IN_SOURCE_ALLOWED``.  Multibyte encodings
         are used for character sets like the Japanese SJIS.
   * - | ``--named_address_spaces``
       | ``--no_named_address_spaces``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for Embedded C named address space
         qualifiers.  (Not available in C++ modes.)
   * - | ``--named_registers``
       | ``--no_named_registers``
     - | Enable or disable support for Embedded C named-register storage class
         specifiers.  (Not available in C++ modes.)
   * - | ``--namespaces``
       | ``--no_namespaces``
     - | Enable or disable support for namespaces.  The default behavior is
         specified by the configuration constant
         ``DEFAULT_NAMESPACES_ENABLED``.  This option is valid only in C++
         mode.
   * - | ``--nonstd_using_decl``
       | ``--no_nonstd_using_decl``
       |
     - | In C++, controls whether a nonmember using-declaration that specifies
         an unqualified name is allowed.
   * - | ``--nullptr``
       | ``--no_nullptr``
     - | Enable or disable support for the C++11/C23 ``nullptr`` keyword.
   * - | ``--old_specializations``
       | ``--no_old_specializations``
       |
     - | Enable or disable acceptance of old-style template specializations
         (i.e., specializations that do not use the ``template<>`` syntax).
         Default behavior is specified by
         ``DEFAULT_OLD_SPECIALIZATIONS_ALLOWED``.  This option is valid only in
         C++ mode.
   * - | ``--relaxed_abstract_checking``
       | ``--no_relaxed_abstract_checking``
       |
     - | Enable or disable a mode in which checking for the use abstract class
         types as function parameter or return types is performed only when the
         function is defined or called.  Traditionally this checking has been
         performed on non-defining function declarations as well, and this
         behavior can be preserved via the second option.
   * - | ``--restrict``
       | ``--no_restrict``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of the ``restrict`` keyword.
   * - | ``--rtti``
       | ``--no_rtti``
     - | Enable or disable support for RTTI (runtime type information)
         features: ``dynamic_cast``, ``typeid``.  The default behavior is
         specified by the configuration constant ``DEFAULT_RTTI_ENABLED``.
         This option is valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--rvalue_ctor_is_copy_ctor``
       | ``--rvalue_ctor_is_not_copy_ctor``
       |
     - | Determines whether an rvalue (or "move") constructor is treated as a
         copy constructor (the default) or not.  If rvalue constructors are
         treated as copy constructors, a user-declared rvalue constructor will
         inhibit the implicit generation of a traditional copy constructor.
   * - | ``--rvalue_refs``
       | ``--no_rvalue_refs``
     - | Enable or disable support for rvalue references.  (Only valid in C++
         mode.)
   * - | ``--sun_linker_scope``
       | ``--no_sun_linker_scope``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for Sun CC 5.5 link scope specifiers
         (``__global``, ``__symbolic``, and ``__hidden``).  The default setting
         is supplied by ``DEFAULT_SUN_LINKER_SCOPE_ALLOWED``.
   * - | ``--thread_local_storage``
       | ``--no_thread_local_storage``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the C++11 ``thread_local`` specifier (and, if so
         configured, the ``__thread`` specifier) to indicate that variables
         should be stored in thread-local storage.  By default, the
         ``__thread`` specifier is enabled in Sun mode and in GNU mode when
         ``gnu_version`` >= 30400.
   * - | ``--trigraphs``
       | ``--no_trigraphs``
       |
     - | Enable or disable recognition of trigraphs.  The default behavior is
         specified by the ``DEFAULT_TRIGRAPHS_ALLOWED`` configuration constant.
   * - | ``--typename``
       | ``--no_typename``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of ``typename``.  The default value is
         supplied by ``DEFAULT_TYPENAME_ENABLED``.  This option is valid only
         in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--type_traits_helpers``
       | ``--no_type_traits_helpers``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for type traits helpers (like ``__is_union``
         and ``__has_virtual_destructor``; intended to ease the implementation
         of ISO/IEC TR 19768).  Only valid in C++.  Type traits helpers are
         enabled in all C++ modes by default, except in GNU and Sun C++ modes.
   * - | ``--uliterals``
       | ``--no_uliterals``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of U-literals (string literals of the
         forms ``U"..."`` and ``u"..."``, and character literals of the forms
         ``U'...'`` and ``u'...'``).  In C++ mode, this also enables or
         disables the C++11 ``char16_t`` and ``char32_t`` keywords.
   * - | ``--unrestricted_unions``
       | ``--no_unrestricted_unions``
       |
     - | Enable or disable C++11-style "unrestricted unions" (i.e., unions with
         data members that have nontrivial initialization and/or destruction
         semantics).  This option can currently not be enabled in Microsoft
         mode.
   * - | ``--user_defined_literals``
       | ``--no_user_defined_literals``
       |
     - | Enable or disable C++11-style "user-defined literals," i.e.,
         literals with a suffix designating an operator function that is to
         be called to produce the value of the literal, e.g., ``12.34_km``,
         which calls ``operator ""_km(12.34)``.
   * - | ``--utf8_char_literals``
       | ``--no_utf8_char_literals``
       |
     - | Enable or disable C++17-style ``UTF-8`` character literals (e.g.,
         ``u8'a'``).  Enabled by default in C++17 mode as well as when
         ``microsoft_version`` >= 1900.
   * - | ``--variadic_macros``
       | ``--no_variadic_macros``
     - | Enable or disable support for variadic macros (a C99 feature that is
         also available in C++ mode).
   * - | ``--extended_variadic_macros``
       | ``--no_extended_variadic_macros``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for "extended variadic macros," an extension
         that emulates the behavior of certain other C compilers when it comes
         to variadic macros.
   * - | ``--variadic_templates``
       | ``--no_variadic_templates``
       |
     - | Enable or disable support for "variadic templates," a C++11 feature
         that allows declaration of templates with a variable number of
         arguments.  The default value is dependent on the major language mode
         and on ``DEFAULT_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES_ENABLED``.  This option is valid
         only in C++ modes.
   * - | ``--vla``
       | ``--no_vla``
     - | Enable or disable support for "variable length arrays," a C99 feature
         and an extension in some other modes that allows the declaration and
         use of arrays of automatic storage duration with dimensions that are
         fixed at run time.  These options are available only if
         ``VLA_ALLOWED`` is configured to TRUE.
   * - | ``--wchar_t_keyword``
       | ``--no_wchar_t_keyword``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of ``wchar_t`` as a keyword.  The
         default value is supplied by ``DEFAULT_WCHAR_T_IS_KEYWORD``.  This
         option is valid only in C++ mode.  The front end can be configured to
         define a preprocessing variable when ``wchar_t`` is recognized as a
         keyword.  This preprocessing variable may then be used by the standard
         header files to determine whether a typedef should be supplied to
         define ``wchar_t``.

.. _cli-alt-lang-behaviors:

Alternative Language Behaviors
------------------------------

The following options affect the meaning of various language constructs.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--aligned_new``
       | ``--no_aligned_new``
       |
     - | Enable or disable calling special allocation and deallocation
         functions for types with more stringent alignment requirements than
         the fundamental types (enabled by default in C++17 modes and disabled
         otherwise).
   * - | ``--arg_dep_lookup``
       | ``--no_arg_dep_lookup``
       |
     - | In C++, controls whether argument dependent lookup of unqualified
         function names is performed
   * - | ``--base_assign_op_is_default``
       | ``--no_base_assign_op_is_default``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the anachronism of accepting a copy assignment
         operator that has an input parameter that is a reference to a base
         class as a default copy assignment operator for the derived class.
         This option is enabled by default in cfront compatibility mode.
   * - | ``--class_name_injection``
       | ``--no_class_name_injection``
       |
     - | In C++, controls whether the name of a class is injected into the
         scope of the class (as required by the standard) or is not injected
         (as was true in earlier versions of the C++ language).
   * - | ``--const_string_literals``
       | ``--no_const_string_literals``
       |
     - | Control whether C++ string literals and wide string literals are const
         (as required by the standard) or non-const (as was true in earlier
         versions of the C++ language).
   * - | ``--default_calling_convention`` *calling-convention*
       |
     - | The calling convention that should be assumed for functions that are
         declared without an explicit calling convention.  This option may only
         be used if ``MICROSOFT_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE.
         *calling-convention* must be one of ``__cdecl``, ``__fastcall``,
         ``__stdcall``, and ``__thiscall``.
   * - | ``--default_nocommon_tentative_definitions``
       | ``--default_common_tentative_definitions``
       |
     - | Control whether tentative definitions are placed in "common" storage.
         These options are only available in configurations with
         ``GNU_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` set to TRUE.  The default can be overridden
         for specific variables with the GNU attributes ``common`` and
         ``nocommon``.
   * - | ``--defer_parse_function_templates``
       | ``--no_defer_parse_function_templates``
       |
     - | Enable or disable deferral of prototype instantiations until the
         first actual instantiation of a function.  This is used to permit
         the compilation of programs that contain definitions of unusable
         function templates.  It is enabled by default in g++ mode when
         ``gnu_version`` is >= 30400 (but not when using the C++-generating
         back end).
   * - | ``--dep_name``
       | ``--no_dep_name``
     - | Enable or disable dependent name processing; i.e., the special lookup
         of names used in templates as required by the C++ standard.  The
         default value is supplied by ``DEFAULT_DEPENDENT_NAME_PROCESSING``.
         This option is valid only in C++ mode and ``--dep_name`` cannot be
         combined with ``--no_parse_templates``.
   * - | ``--distinct_template_signatures``
       | ``--no_distinct_template_signatures``
       |
     - | Control whether the signatures for template functions can match those
         for non-template functions when the functions appear in different
         compilation units.  (This option is available only on versions that do
         name mangling on the names of external entities.) The default is
         ``--distinct_template_signatures``, under which a normal function
         cannot be used to satisfy the need for a template instance; e.g., a
         function "``void f(int)``" could not be used to satisfy the need for
         an instantiation of a template "``void f(T)``" with ``T`` set to
         ``int``.  ``--no_distinct_template_signatures`` provides the older
         language behavior, under which a non-template function can match a
         template function.  Also controls whether function templates may have
         template parameters that are not used in the function signature of the
         function template.
   * - | ``--enum_overloading``
       | ``--no_enum_overloading``
     - | Enable or disable support for using operator functions to overload
         builtin operations on enum-typed operands.
   * - | ``--far_data_pointers``
       | ``--near_data_pointers``
       | ``--far_code_pointers``
       | ``--near_code_pointers``
     - | Set the default size for pointers when support for ``near`` and
         ``far`` is enabled (e.g., in Microsoft 16-bit mode).  Ignored in other
         modes.
   * - | ``--friend_injection``
       | ``--no_friend_injection``
       |
     - | In C++, controls whether the name of a class or function that is
         declared only in friend declarations is visible when using the normal
         lookup mechanisms.  When friend names are injected, they are visible
         to such lookups.  When friend names are not injected (as required by
         the standard), function names are visible only when using
         argument-dependent lookup, and class names are never visible.
   * - | ``--func_prototype_tags``
       | ``--no_func_prototype_tags``
     - | in C, controls whether tag types first
         declared in a function prototype belong to the function prototype
         scope (standard C behavior) or to a surrounding scope (default
         Microsoft C behavior).
   * - | ``--gcc89_inlining``
     - | Use the GNU C89 semantics of ``inline`` in C99 mode.  (Not valid in
         C++ modes.)
   * - | ``--gen_move_operations``
       | ``--no_gen_move_operations``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the generation of move constructors and move
         assignment operators according to standard C++11 rules.
   * - | ``--guiding_decls``
       | ``--no_guiding_decls``
     - | Enable or disable recognition of "guiding declarations" of template
         functions.  A guiding declaration is a function declaration that
         matches an instance of a function template but has no explicit
         definition (since its definition derives from the function template).
         For example:

         .. code:: c++

            template <class T> void f(T) { ... }
            void f(int);

       | When regarded as a guiding declaration, ``f(int)`` is an instance of
         the template; otherwise, it is an independent function for which a
         definition must be supplied.  If ``--no_guiding_decls`` is combined
         with ``--old_specializations``, a specialization of a non-member
         template function is not recognized -- it is treated as a definition
         of an independent function.  Default behavior is specified by
         ``DEFAULT_GUIDING_DECLS_ALLOWED``.  This option is valid only in C++
         mode.
   * - | ``--ignore_std``
     - | Enable a ``g++`` compatibility feature that makes the ``std``
         namespace a synonym for the global namespace.
   * - | ``--implicit_extern_c_type_conversion``
       | ``--no_implicit_extern_c_type_conversion``
       |
     - | Enable or disable an extension to permit implicit type conversion in
         C++ between a pointer to an ``extern "C"`` function and a pointer to
         an ``extern "C++"`` function.  This extension is allowed in
         environments where C and C++ functions share the same calling
         conventions: ``IMPL_CONV_BETWEEN_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_PTRS_POSSIBLE``
         must be set for it to be available.  (It is useful for cfront
         compatibility when ``DEFAULT_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_TYPES_ARE_DISTINCT``
         is TRUE -- in standard C++ the linkage specification is part of the
         function type, with the consequence that otherwise identical function
         types, one declared ``extern "C"`` and the other declared ``extern
         "C++"``, are viewed as distinct.)
   * - | ``--implicit_noexcept``
       | ``--no_implicit_noexcept``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the implicit generation of exception specifications
         for user-declared destructors and deallocation functions in C++11
         mode.  (In strict C++11 mode, it is enabled by default, whereas in
         other C++11 modes it is disabled by default.)
   * - | ``--implicit_typename``
       | ``--no_implicit_typename``
       |
     - | Enable or disable implicit determination, from context, whether a
         template parameter dependent name is a type or nontype.  The default
         value is supplied by ``DEFAULT_IMPLICIT_TYPENAME_ENABLED``.  This
         option is valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--late_tiebreaker``
       | ``--early_tiebreaker``
     - | Select the way that tie-breakers (e.g., cv-qualifier differences)
         apply in overload resolution.  In "early" tie-breaker processing, the
         tie-breakers are considered at the same time as other measures of the
         goodness of the match of an argument value and the corresponding
         parameter type (this is the standard approach).  In "late" tiebreaker
         processing, tie-breakers are ignored during the initial comparison,
         and considered only if two functions are otherwise equally good on all
         arguments; the tie-breakers can then be used to choose one function
         over another.
   * - | ``--long_lifetime_temps``
       | ``--short_lifetime_temps``
       |
     - | Select the lifetime for temporaries: "short" means to end of full
         expression; "long" means to the earliest of end of scope, end of
         switch clause, or the next label.  "short" is standard C++, and "long"
         is what cfront uses (the cfront compatibility modes select "long" by
         default).
   * - | ``--long_preserving_rules``
       | ``--no_long_preserving_rules``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the K&R usual arithmetic conversion rules with
         respect to ``long``.  This means the rules of K&R I, Appendix A, 6.6,
         not the rules used by the pcc compiler.  The significant difference is
         in the handling of "``long`` *op* ``unsigned int``" when ``int`` and
         ``long`` are the same size.  The ANSI/ISO/pcc rules say the result is
         ``unsigned long``, but K&R I says the result is ``long`` (``unsigned
         long`` did not exist in K&R I).
   * - | ``--max_depth_constexpr_call=`` *n*
       | ``--max_cost_constexpr_call=`` *n*
       |
     - | Specify the maximum depth of recursion or the maximum "cost" for
         folding a top-level ``constexpr`` call (function or constructor).  In
         C++11 modes, the "cost" is the number of calls expanded from a single
         top-level call.  In C++14 modes, the "cost" is a combination of the
         number of calls interpreted and the number of loop iterations
         performed during the interpretation of a top-level call.
   * - | ``--ms_rvalue_cast``
       | ``--no_ms_rvalue_cast``
       |
     - | Explicitly disable or enable treating a cast of an lvalue to its own
         type as that same lvalue.  (``--ms_rvalue_cast`` corresponds to
         standard behavior, but Microsoft compilers traditionally behaved
         otherwise.) Implies Microsoft mode.
   * - | ``--ms_strict_ternary``
       | ``--no_ms_strict_ternary``
       |
     - | Enable or disable strict standard-conforming behavior of the
         conditional ternary operator (?:) in Microsoft mode.  It is disabled
         by default in Microsoft mode, unless Microsoft permissive mode is
         disabled (see ``--no_ms_permissive``).  Implies Microsoft mode.
   * - | ``--nonconst_ref_anachronism``
       | ``--no_nonconst_ref_anachronism``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the anachronism of allowing a reference to nonconst
         to bind to a class rvalue of the right type.  This anachronism is also
         enabled by the ``--anachronisms`` option and the cfront-compatibility
         options.
   * - | ``--nonstd_anonymous_unions``
       | ``--no_nonstd_anonymous_unions``
       |
     - | Enable or disable extensions to the C++ anonymous union feature
         (including of anonymous "structs" or "classes").  This option can also
         be used in C modes.  Enabled by default in GNU and Microsoft modes,
         and disabled by default in strict modes.
   * - | ``--nonstd_default_arg_deduction``
       | ``--no_nonstd_default_arg_deduction``
       |
     - | Controls whether default arguments are retained as part of deduced
         function types.  The C++ standard requires that default arguments not
         be part of deduced function types.
   * - | ``--nonstd_instantiation_lookup``
       | ``--no_nonstd_instantiation_lookup``
       |
     - | Controls whether the lookup of names during template instantiation
         should, instead of the normal lookup rules, use rules that were part
         of the C++98 working paper for some time during the development of the
         standard.  In this mode, names are looked up in both the namespace of
         the template definition and in the namespace in which a template
         entity was first referenced in a way that would require an
         instantiation.
   * - | ``--nonstd_qualifier_deduction``
       | ``--no_nonstd_qualifier_deduction``
       |
     - | Controls whether nonstandard template argument deduction should be
         performed in the qualifier portion of a qualified name.  With this
         feature enabled, a template argument for the template parameter ``T``
         can de deduced in contexts like ``A<T>::B`` or ``T::B``.  The standard
         deduction mechanism treats these as nondeduced contexts that use the
         values of template parameters that were either explicitly specified or
         deduced elsewhere.
   * - | ``--old_id_chars``
       | ``--no_old_id_chars``
     - | Controls whether the set of extended characters accepted in C++
         identifiers should be those specified by pre-C++23 C++ standards or by
         Unicode Standard Annex #44.  The latter is the default in all C++
         modes, because the C++ Standard Committee adopted the Unicode
         specification of identifier characters both for C++23 and
         retroactively for earlier standards.
   * - | ``--old_for_init``
       | ``--new_for_init``
     - | Control the scope of a declaration in a ``for-init-statement``.  The
         old (cfront-compatible) scoping rules mean the declaration is in the
         scope to which the ``for`` statement itself belongs; the new
         (standard-conforming) rules in effect wrap the entire ``for``
         statement in its own implicitly generated scope.  The default behavior
         is specified by configuration constant
         ``DEFAULT_USE_NONSTANDARD_FOR_INIT_SCOPE``.  This option is valid only
         in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--pack_alignment`` *n*
     - | Set the default alignment for packing classes and structs to *n*, a
         power-of-2 value within the range defined by
         ``TARG_MINIMUM_PACK_ALIGNMENT`` and ``TARG_MAXIMUM_PACK_ALIGNMENT``.
         The argument *n* is the default maximum alignment for nonstatic data
         members; it can be overridden by a ``#pragma pack`` directive.  This
         option is allowed only when ``USER_CONTROL_OF_STRUCT_PACKING`` is
         TRUE.
   * - | ``--parse_templates``
       | ``--no_parse_templates``
       |
     - | Enable or disable the parsing of nonclass templates in their generic
         form (i.e., even if they are not really instantiated).  It is done by
         default if dependent name processing is enabled.  This option is valid
         only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--preserve_lvalues_with_same_type_casts``
       | ``--no_preserve_lvalues_with_same_type_casts``
       |
     - | Explicitly enable or disable treating a cast of an lvalue to its own
         type as that same lvalue (whereas both C and C++ specify that such
         casts result in rvalues).  Enabled by default in Microsoft and Sun
         modes.
   * - | ``--require_func_prototypes``
       | ``--no_require_func_prototypes``
     - | In C, controls whether old-style non-prototype function declarators
         are recognized. If not, something like "``int f();``" is equivalent
         to "``int f(void);``". The default is that non-prototype function
         declarators are not recognized in C23 mode, while they are recognized
         in earlier C modes.
   * - | ``--short_enums``
       | ``--no_short_enums``
     - | Enable or disable a mode in which all enumeration types are "packed"
         (meaning that the underlying type of the enumeration is chosen to be
         the smallest integer that will accommodate the enumerator constants).
         Only valid in GNU C compatibility mode.
   * - | ``--signed_bit_fields``
       |
     - | Make bit fields declared with a plain integer type (e.g., ``short`` or
         ``int``, but not ``signed short`` or ``unsigned int``) signed.
   * - | ``--signed_chars``
       | ``-s``
     - | Make plain ``char`` signed.  The default signedness for ``char`` is
         selected at the time of installation of the front end (information on
         this appears in a later section of this document).  When plain
         ``char`` is signed, the macro ``__SIGNED_CHARS__`` is defined by the
         front end.
   * - | ``--special_subscript_cost``
       | ``--no_special_subscript_cost``
       |
     - | Enable or disable a special nonstandard weighting of the conversion to
         the integral operand of the ``[]`` operator in overload resolution.
         This is a compatibility feature that may be useful with some existing
         code.  The special cost is enabled by default in cfront 3.0 mode.
         With this feature enabled, the following code compiles without error:

         .. code:: c++

           struct A {
             A();
             operator int *();
             int operator[](unsigned);
           };
           void main() {
             A a;
             a[0]; // Ambiguous, but allowed with
                   // this option operator[]
                   // is chosen
           }

       | As of July 1996, the above is again acceptable, if ``ptrdiff_t`` is
         configured as ``long``.  Using a parameter of type ``ptrdiff_t``
         (instead of ``unsigned``\ ``int``) is recommended for portability.
   * - | ``--no_stdarg_builtin``
     - | Disable special treatment of the ``<stdarg.h>`` header.  When enabled,
         the ``<stdarg.h>`` header is treated as a built-in, and references to
         its macros (``va_start`` et al) are passed through as such in
         generated C or C++ code.  The default value is supplied by
         ``DEFAULT_PASS_STDARG_REFERENCES_TO_GENERATED_CODE``.  This option
         cannot be used when the feature is disabled by default.
   * - | ``--unsigned_bit_fields``
       |
     - | Make bit fields declared with a plain integer type (e.g., ``short`` or
         ``int``, but not ``signed short`` or ``unsigned int``) unsigned.
   * - | ``--unsigned_chars``
       | ``-u``
     - | Make plain ``char`` unsigned.  The default signedness for ``char`` is
         selected at the time of installation of the front end (information on
         this appears in a later section of this document).
   * - | ``--using_std``
       | ``--no_using_std``
     - | Enable or disable implicit use of the ``std`` namespace when standard
         header files are included.  The default behavior is specified by the
         configuration constant ``DEFAULT_IMPLICIT_USING_STD``.  This option is
         valid only in C++ mode.  Note that this does *not* do the equivalent
         of putting a "``using namespace std;``" in the program to allow old
         programs to be compiled with new header files; it has a special and
         localized meaning related to the EDG versions of certain header files,
         and is unlikely to be of much use to end-users of the Front End.

Template Instantiation Options
------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--auto_instantiation``
       | ``--no_auto_instantiation``
       | ``-T``
     - | Enable or disable automatic instantiation of templates.  The
         ``-T`` option is equivalent to ``--auto_instantiation``.  The
         default behavior is specified by the configuration flag
         ``DEFAULT_AUTOMATIC_INSTANTIATION_MODE``.  See
         :ref:`template-instantiation`.  This option is valid only in C++
         mode.
   * - | ``--definition_list_file`` *file_name*
       |
     - | This option specifies the name of the template definition list file
         passed between the front end and the prelinker.  This file is a
         temporary file and does not remain after the compilation is complete.
         This option is supplied for use by the driver program that invokes the
         front end and is not intended to be used by end-users.
   * - | ``--exported_template_file`` *file-name*
       |
     - | This option specifies the name to be used for the exported template
         file used for processing of exported templates.  This option is
         supplied for use by the driver program that invokes the front end and
         is not intended to be used by end-users.
   * - | ``--ii_file`` *file-name*
     - | This option specifies the name to be used for the template
         instantiation request file used in automatic instantiation mode.  This
         option is supplied for use by the driver program that invokes the
         front end and is not intended to be used by end-users.
   * - | ``--implicit_include``
       | ``--no_implicit_include``
       | ``-B``
     - | Enable or disable implicit inclusion of source files as a method
         of finding definitions of template entities to be instantiated.
         ``-B`` is equivalent to ``--implicit_include``.  The default
         behavior is specified by the configuration flag
         ``DEFAULT_IMPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INCLUSION_MODE``.  See
         :ref:`template-instantiation`.  This option is valid only in C++
         mode.
   * - | ``--instantiate`` *mode*
       | ``-t``\ *mode*
     - | Control instantiation of external template entities.  External
         template entities are external (i.e., noninline and nonstatic)
         template functions, variables, and template static data members.  The
         instantiation mode determines the template entities for which code
         should be generated based on the template definition):

       ``none``
          Instantiate no template entities. This is the default.

       ``used``
          Instantiate only the template entities that are used in this
          compilation.

       ``all``
          Instantiate all template entities whether or not they are used.

       ``local``
          Instantiate only the template entities that are used in this
          compilation and force those entities to be local to this
          compilation.

       | See :ref:`template-instantiation`.  This option is valid only in
         C++ mode.
   * - | ``--instantiation_dir`` *dir-name*
       |
     - | When ``--one_instantiation_per_object`` is used, this option can be
         used to specify a directory into which the generated object files (or
         C files, if the C-generating back end if being used) should be put.
         The ``eccp`` script always specifies this option when invoking the
         front end, with the default of ``Template.dir`` if the option is not
         specified by the user.
   * - | ``--one_instantiation_per_object``
       |
     - | Put out each template instantiation in this compilation (function,
         variable, or static data member) in a separate object file.  The
         primary object file contains everything else in the compilation, i.e.,
         everything that isn't an instantiation.  Having each instantiation in
         a separate object file is very useful when creating libraries, because
         it allows the user of the library to pull in only the instantiations
         that are needed.  That can be essential if two different libraries
         include some of the same instantiations.  This option is valid only in
         C++ mode, and only if the configuration constant
         ``ONE_INSTANTIATION_PER_OBJECT`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--pending_instantiations=`` *n*
       |
     - | Specifies the maximum number of instantiations of a given template
         that may be in process of being instantiated at a given time.  This is
         used to detect runaway recursive instantiations.  If *n* is zero,
         there is no limit.  The default is specified by the configuration
         parameter ``DEFAULT_MAX_PENDING_INSTANTIATIONS``.
   * - | ``--suppress_instantiation_flags``
       |
     - | When automatic instantiation is being used, this option suppresses the
         generation of the special symbols used by the prelinker to do
         automatic instantiation processing.  This option is for use by the
         driver and prelinker and should not be used directly by users.  This
         option is used by to implement the driver option that removes the
         instantiation flags from object files once the prelinking step has
         completed.
   * - | ``--template_directory`` *dir*
       |
     - | Specifies a directory name to be placed on the exported template
         search path.  The directories are used to find the definitions of
         exported templates and are searched in the order in which they are
         specified on the command-line.  The current directory is always the
         first entry on the search path.
   * - | ``--template_info_file`` *file-name*
       |
     - | This option specifies the name to be used for the template
         instantiation information file used in automatic instantiation mode.
         This option is supplied for use by the driver program that invokes the
         front end and is not intended to be used by end-users.

Code Generation Options
-----------------------

The following options control the IL produced, the C-generating back end, or
the C++-generating back end.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--no_code_gen``
       | ``-n``
     - | Do syntax-checking only, i.e., do not run the back end.
   * - | ``--force_vtbl``
     - | Force definition of virtual function tables in cases where the
         heuristic used by the front end to decide on definition of virtual
         function tables provides no guidance.  See ``--suppress_vtbl``.  This
         option is valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--no_il_lowering``
       | ``-N``
     - | On versions that include IL lowering and that write an intermediate
         language file, suppress both IL lowering and the back end, and write
         an unlowered (i.e., C++ rather than C) IL file.  Probably not of
         interest to end users.
   * - | ``--inline_statement_limit`` *size*
       |
     - | When inlining is enabled, sets the maximum size (in number of lowered
         statements) for a routine to be inlinable.  A value of zero allows an
         inlined routine to be any size.  Only available when
         ``MINIMAL_INLINING`` is configured to be TRUE.
   * - | ``--inlining``
       | ``--no_inlining``
     - | Enable or disable minimal inlining of function calls.  These options
         are available only when ``MINIMAL_INLINING`` is configured to be TRUE.
         The default is to do inlining when the C-generating back end is used.
   * - | ``--keep_restrict_in_signatures``
       | ``--no_keep_restrict_in_signatures``
     - | In most modern configurations, top-level parameter type qualifiers
         are removed from function types.  In such configurations, this
         option overrides or preserves that behavior for the ``restrict``
         qualifier; i.e., when the option is enabled, the mangled name of a
         function will reflect the presence of top-level restrict parameter
         type qualifiers.
   * - | ``--module_init`` *name1,name2,...*
       | ``-i``\ *name1,name2,...*
     - | When generating C output for testing (see ``c_gen_be`` in an
         Appendix), when compiling in C mode, and if the current compilation
         contains a main program, force calling of the file-scope
         initialization routines in the indicated compiled units.  This is
         needed only when there are file-scope union initializations in
         translation units that do not contain a main program.  A message will
         be issued during compilation of such units, indicating the need for
         the ``--module_init`` option.  All necessary names must be specified
         in one ``--module_init`` option; a second ``--module_init`` will
         overwrite the original list, not add to it.  This option is not needed
         when object code is generated by a back end other than the
         C-generating back end, nor is it needed when the C-generating back end
         is configured to generate ANSI C.  This option is not needed in C++
         mode, because C++ has a language mechanism for getting initialization
         code executed at program start-up.
   * - | ``--gen_c_clang_version`` *version-number*
       |
     - | When using the C- or C++-generating back end to produce code that
         is to be compiled with the ``clang`` compiler, this specifies the
         version of the compiler being used (e.g., 150000 for version
         15.0).  This option is supplied for use by the driver program that
         invokes the front end and is not intended to be used by end-users.
   * - | ``--gen_c_gnu_version`` *version-number*
       |
     - | When using the C- or C++-generating back end to produce code that
         is to be compiled with the ``gcc`` compiler, this specifies the
         version of the compiler being used (e.g., 140100 for version
         14.1.0).  This option is supplied for use by the driver program
         that invokes the front end and is not intended to be used by
         end-users.
   * - | ``--gen_c_msvc_version`` *version-number*
       |
     - | When using the C- or C++-generating back end to produce code that
         is to be compiled with the Microsoft compiler, this specifies the
         version of the compiler being used (e.g., 1932 for Visual Studio
         2022 Update 2).  (This option is identical to the earlier
         ``--msvc_target_version`` option, which continues to be accepted.)
         This option is supplied for use by the driver program that invokes
         the front end and is not intended to be used by end-users.
   * - | ``--remove_unneeded_entities``
       | ``--no_remove_unneeded_entities``
       |
     - | Enable or disable an optimization to prune the IL tree of types,
         variables, routines, and related IL entries that are not "really
         needed." (Something may be referenced but unneeded if it is referenced
         only by something that is itself unneeded; certain entities, such as
         global variables and routines defined in the translation unit, are
         always considered to be needed.) The positive form of the option is
         available only when ``MAINTAIN_NEEDED_FLAGS`` is TRUE.
   * - | ``--suppress_vtbl``
       | ``-V``
     - | Suppress definition of virtual function tables in cases where the
         heuristic used by the front end to decide on definition of virtual
         function tables provides no guidance.  The virtual function table for
         a class is defined in a compilation if the compilation contains a
         definition of the first non-inline non-pure virtual function of the
         class.  For classes that contain no such function, the default
         behavior is to define the virtual function table (but to define it as
         a local static entity).  The option ``--suppress_vtbl`` suppresses the
         definition of the virtual function tables for such classes, and
         ``--force_vtbl`` forces the definition of the virtual function table
         for such classes.  ``--force_vtbl`` differs from the default behavior
         in that it does not force the definition to be local.  This option is
         valid only in C++ mode.
   * - | ``--target`` *target-config-name*
       |
     - | For configurations that support multiple targets, specifies that the
         target configuration named *target-config-name* should be used for the
         compilation.  If no ``--target`` option is specified, the default
         target configuration (which may or may not be the legacy
         configuration) is used.

Precompiled Header Options
--------------------------

The following options control how precompiled header files are generated and
used.

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--pch``
     - | Automatically use and/or create a precompiled header file -- for
         details, see :ref:`precompiled-headers`.  If
         ``--use_pch`` or ``--create_pch`` (manual PCH mode) appears on the
         command line following this option, its effect is erased.
   * - | ``--create_pch`` *file-name*
     - | If other conditions are satisfied (see
         :ref:`precompiled-headers`), create a precompiled header file with
         the specified name.  If ``--pch`` (automatic PCH mode) or
         ``--use_pch`` appears on the command line following this option,
         its effect is erased.
   * - | ``--use_pch`` *file-name*
     - | Use a precompiled header file of the specified name as part of the
         current compilation.  If ``--pch`` (automatic PCH mode) or
         ``--create_pch`` appears on the command line following this option,
         its effect is erased.
   * - | ``--pch_dir`` *directory-name*
     - | The directory in which to search for and/or create a precompiled
         header file.  This option may be used with automatic PCH mode
         (``--pch``) or with manual PCH mode (``--create_pch`` or
         ``--use_pch``).
   * - | ``--pch_messages``
       | ``--no_pch_messages``
     - | Enable or disable the display of a message indicating that a
         precompiled header file was created or used in the current
         compilation.
   * - | ``--pch_verbose``
     - | In automatic PCH mode, for each precompiled header file that cannot be
         used for the current compilation, a message is displayed giving the
         reason that the file cannot be used.
   * - | ``--pch_mem`` *size*
     - | The number of 1024-byte units of preallocated memory in which to save
         precompiled-header state (only if ``USE_MMAP_FOR_MEMORY_REGIONS`` is
         FALSE).

C++/CLI Options
---------------

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--mscorlib_file_name`` *file-name*
     - | Use the given assembly metadata file instead of ``mscorlib.dll`` to
         import system types.
   * - | ``--preusing`` *file-name*
     - | Import the given assembly metadata file prior to processing the input
         source (but after importing ``mscorlib.dll`` or the file specified
         with the ``--mscorlib_file_name`` option).
   * - | ``--using_directory`` *directory-name*
       |
     - | Add the given directory to the search path used when searching for
         assembly metadata files.
   * - | ``--using_framework_directory``
       | ``--no_using_framework_directory``
       |
     - | Do or do not implicitly include the installation directory of the
         Microsoft .NET runtime in the search path used when searching for
         assembly metadata files.  The default is to include that directory.
   * - | ``--vcmeta_directory`` *directory-name*
       |
     - | Search for the ``vcmeta.dll`` file in the specified directory.  If
         omitted, ``vcmeta.dll`` is searched for in the same directory as the
         module that contains the front end.

Front End Debugging Options
---------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--db``\ *n*
       | ``--db``\ *name*\ ``=``\ *n*
       | ``-d``\ *n*
       | ``-d``\ *name*\ ``=``\ *n*
     - | Set the debug output level in the front end, which controls the
         output of flow-tracing and similar information to the debug output
         file (``stderr``).  ``--db``\ *n* sets the debug level to *n* (in
         the range 1-5) for the entire execution of the compiler (higher
         values generate more voluminous debugging output).  One can
         control the debug output more precisely by specifying a routine
         name and the debug level desired upon entry to that routine, as in
         ``--db``\ *name*\ ``=``\ *n*.  Regardless of the previous setting
         of the debug level, it will be changed to the indicated value on
         entry to the indicated routine; on exit, it will be restored to
         its former value.  One can also use ``+=`` or ``-=`` in place of
         ``=`` in that option to increase or decrease the debug level
         relative to its current value.  The former value is also restored
         on exit from the routine in those cases.  Ordinarily, a message is
         written to debug output whenever the debug level is changed (i.e.,
         both on entry and exit in the above cases).  If that is not
         desirable, a ``!`` (implying "not") can be appended to the level
         number in the command-line option, to indicate that the
         level-change messages should not be produced for that request.
         Several routine names can be specified, and/or several requests
         can be made, by separating them with commas, as in the following:

           ``--db fe_init,fe_wrapup+=2,get_token=3``
   * - | ``-d-``\ *name1*\ ``,-``\ *name2*\ ``,``\ *...*
     - | Enable the named "debug flags", which will enable debug output
         associated with the flag.  For example, ``-d-dump_layout`` produces
         output related to the class type layout process.
   * - | ``-d#``\ *name1*\ ``,#``\ *name2*\ ``,``\ *...*
     - | Disable the named "debug flags".
   * - | ``--db_name=``\ *name*
     - | Enable debug output for source entities with the given name.  Not all
         debug output takes this option into account; i.e., even with this
         option some debug output not associated with the given name may be
         produced.  When simultaneously compiling multiple translation units,
         entities in all translation units are considered by default.  The
         given name can be restricted to entities in the primary translation
         units by preceding it with ``[]`` or to entities in a secondary
         translation unit by preceding it with ``[``\ *file*\ ``]`` where
         *file* is the name of the secondary source file.  For example,

           ``-d-trans_corresp --db_name=[x.cpp]A::f``

       | will output debugging information about cross-translation-unit
         correspondences for a member ``A::f`` declared in a secondary
         translation unit defined by source file x.cpp.

Miscellaneous Options
---------------------

.. list-table::

   * - | ``--version``
       | ``-v``
     - | Display the version number of the front end, and the Edison Design
         Group copyright.
   * - | ``--building_runtime``
     - | Used to indicate that the EDG runtime library is being compiled.  This
         causes additional macros to be predefined that are used to pass target
         configuration information from the front end to the runtime.
   * - | ``--edg_base_dir``
     - | The name of the directory in which to find files needed by the front
         end at execution time.  This option is supplied for use by the driver
         program that invokes the front end and is not intended to be used by
         end-users.
   * - | ``--dump_command_options``
     - | Display the complete set of ``--``\ *name*
         command-line options recognized by the front end in a format that is
         compatible with, e.g., the bash shell's complete command to allow the
         shell's completion facility to be used with front end options.
   * - | ``--dump_configuration``
     - | Display the complete set of configuration
         macros with which the front end was built.  The output (to the error
         output file) can be captured and used as the contents of the
         ``defines.h`` file to recreate that configuration.  This option is
         available only in executables built with ``DEBUG`` set to TRUE.
   * - | ``--dump_legacy_as_target`` *target-config-name*
     - | Displays the legacy configuration in such a manner that the
         configuration can be used to specify a new target configuration named
         *target-config-name*.  For customers who have multiple versions of the
         front end (each configured for a specific target), this option can be
         used to generate a separate target configuration for each of the
         legacy configurations, and the output combined to form a single
         configuration where the target can be specified at run-time (via the
         ``--target`` option).  This option is available only in executables
         built with ``DEBUG`` set to TRUE.  The output is directed to the error
         output file.
   * - | ``--incognito``
       | ``--no_incognito``
     - | Enable or disable the suppression of implicitly-defined
         EDG-specific macros such as ``__EDG__`` and ``__EDG_VERSION__``.
         Suppressing these macros facilitates compilation of code that
         incorrectly configures itself via conditional compilation when it
         detects that the compiler is based on the EDG front end.  The
         default behavior of the front end is determined by the value of
         the configuration macro DEFAULT_INCOGNITO.
   * - | ``--il_display``
     - | Displays the IL in a human-readable form.  This is
         the same output that would be generated by writing the IL to a file
         and displaying it with the ``edgcpdisp`` utility.  The IL that is
         displayed is lowered IL (if the configuration does lowering) unless
         the ``--no_il_lowering`` command-line option is also specified.
   * - | ``--mmap_address`` *address*
     - | Specify the fixed address to be used in calls to ``mmap``.  Valid
         addresses are specific to the host operating system (and
         architecture), and may change from invocation to invocation
         (depending, say on which shared libraries are loaded).  The address
         chosen should be aligned to the page size of the host.  The use of a
         fixed address for ``mmap`` is useful in cases where pre-compiled
         header files are used (to ensure that the same address space is
         available from one invocation of the front end to another).  This
         option is available only in executables built with
         ``USE_FIXED_ADDRESS_FOR_MMAP`` set to TRUE.
   * - | ``--check_unicode_security``
       | ``--no_check_unicode_security``
     - | Enable or disable checking of comments, string literals, and
         identifiers for Unicode patterns that could be used to disguise
         malicious source code by making it appear innocuous; suspicious
         patterns are reported as warnings.  Checking is only applicable to
         UTF-encoded Unicode source and header files.  These options are
         available only in executables built with
         ``UNICODE_VULNERABILITY_CHECKING_SUPPORTED`` set to TRUE.
   * - | ``--module_import_diagnostics``
       | ``--no_module_import_diagnostics``
     - | Enable or disable the issuing of diagnostic messages during the import
         of entities from a module.  The option can be used to reduce verbosity
         and condense diagnostics that do not relate to the source file being
         compiled.  The default setting is specified by the
         ``DEFAULT_MODULE_IMPORT_DIAG_ENABLED`` configuration macro.
   * - | ``--wdir`` *directory-name*
     - | Specify the directory to use in expanding relative path names.  All
         relative paths are expanded after command-line processing is complete,
         so that any ``--wdir`` options preceding the final one have no effect.

Environment Variables
=====================

The environment variable ``USR_INCLUDE`` can be set to a directory to be used
instead of ``/usr/include`` on the standard include file search list.  (Of
course, this has no effect if the front end has been configured to have an
empty "standard list" of include files.)

When the front end is built with the ``__MICROSOFT_OS__`` flag set, the
environment variable ``TMP`` is used to specify the directory to be used for
temporary files.  If ``TMP`` is not set, and when ``__MICROSOFT_OS__`` is not
set, the environment variable ``TMPDIR`` is used to indicate a directory to be
used for temporary files.  If ``TMPDIR`` is not set, a default temporary
directory (often, ``/usr/tmp``) is used.  (Note: at the present time, the front
end only uses temporary files when generating an intermediate language file for
immediate use by a back end called in the same program, and in the C-generating
back end.)

Diagnostic Messages
===================

Diagnostic messages have an associated *severity*, as follows:

* | Catastrophic errors indicate problems of such severity that the compilation
    cannot continue.  For example: command-line errors, internal errors, and
    missing include files.  If multiple source files are being compiled, any
    source files after the current one will not be compiled.
* | Errors indicate violations of the syntax or semantic rules of the C or C++
    language.  Compilation continues, but object code is not generated.
* | Warnings indicate something valid but questionable.  Compilation continues
    and object code is generated (if no errors are detected).
* | Remarks indicate something that is valid and probably intended, but which a
    careful programmer may want to check.  These diagnostics are not issued by
    default.  Compilation continues and object code is generated (if no errors
    are detected).

Diagnostics are written to the error output file with a form like the
following:

.. code:: text

   "test.c", line 5: a break statement may only be used within a loop
             or switch
       break;
       ^

Diagnostics are normally written to ``stderr``, but the front end can be
configured to use ``stdout`` by setting the ``DIRECT_ERROR_OUTPUT_TO_STDOUT``
configuration macro.  When this flag is set, messages are directed to
``stdout``, except when doing preprocessing only.  Errors during command-line
processing are always directed to ``stderr``.

Diagnostic messages can optionally be "colorized".  Colorization is enabled
when the ``colorize_diagnostics`` global variable is TRUE.  To support
colorization of diagnostics, diagnostics are annotated when the
``annotate_diagnostics`` global variable is TRUE.  In that case, annotation
sequences are inserted into the diagnostic message itself to identify pieces of
the diagnostic that might later be highlighted in some fashion.  These two
character annotations take the form of an "escape" character
(``DIAG_ANNOTATION_INDICATOR``) followed by an ``a_diagnostic_annotation_kind``
enumerator.  When colorization is enabled, ``format_output_line`` replaces the
annotations with Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) codes that, on most terminal
emulators, can be used to highlight text in various ways.  The SGR codes used
for colorization default to a string specified by ``DEFAULT_EDG_COLORS`` which
can be overridden by the ``EDG_COLORS`` environment variable (if set).  The
string consists of a colon-separated list of elements, where each element
specifies a string that maps to an ``a_diagnostic_annotation_kind`` value
followed by an "``=``" and the SGR string to use when highlighting text of that
kind.  For example:

.. code:: text

   "error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:locus=01:quote=01:range1=32"

A customer can use the annotations in a diagnostic to display the annotated
pieces in any fashion they desire (e.g., when a GUI is available).

Note that the message identifies the file and line involved, and that the
source line itself (with position indicated by the ``^``) follows the message.
If there are several diagnostics in one source line, each diagnostic will have
the form above, with the result that the text of the source line will be
displayed several times, with an appropriate position each time.

Long messages are wrapped to additional lines when necessary.

A configuration flag controls whether or not the string "``error:``" appears,
i.e., the front end can be configured so that the severity string is omitted
when the severity is "``error``".

A command line option may be used to request a shorter form of the diagnostic
output in which the original source line is not displayed and the error message
text is not wrapped when too long to fit on a single line.

A command line option may be used to request that the error number be included
in the diagnostic message.  When displayed, the error number also indicates
whether the error may have its severity overridden on the command line.  If the
severity may be overridden, the error number will include the suffix "``-D``"
(for "discretionary"); otherwise no suffix will be present.

             type specifier
     xxxxx;
     ^

Because an error is determined to be discretionary based on the error severity
associated with a specific context, a given error may be discretionary in some
cases and not in others.

For some messages, a list of entities is useful; they are listed following the
initial error message:

.. code:: text

   "test.c", line 4: error: more than one instance of overloaded function "f"
             matches the argument list:
               function "f(int)"
               function "f(float)"
               argument types are: (double)
       f(1.5);
       ^

In some cases, some additional context information is provided; specifically,
such context information is useful when the front end issues a diagnostic while
doing a template instantiation or while generating a constructor, destructor,
or assignment operator function.  For example:

.. code:: text

   "test.c", line 7: error: "A::A()" is inaccessible
     B x;
        ^
             detected during implicit generation of "B::B()" at line 7

Without the context information, it is very hard to figure out what the error
refers to.

If the front end is configured with ``FULLY_RESOLVED_MACRO_POSITIONS`` (and,
optionally, ``MACRO_INVOCATION_TREE_IN_IL``) set to TRUE, messages referring to
text occurring inside a macro expansion may provide additional information.
This additional information gives the source location from which the text was
copied into the macro expansion (i.e., from a macro definition or one of the
arguments in the top-level macro invocation), as well as possibly the chain of
macro invocations leading to the expanded text to which the diagnostic refers.
If the front end is configured to permit the display of this information, it
can also be enabled or disabled by the command-line option
``--[no_]macro_positions_in_diagnostics``.  The information is presented in a
form like the following:

.. code:: text

   "test.c", line 1: error: identifier "val" is undefined
      #define incr(x) (x)+=val
                           ^
     in expansion of macro "incr" at "test.c", line 2,
     in expansion of macro "next_val" at "test.c", line 4:
      return next_val(i);
             ^

Termination Messages
====================

When the front end is installed without the ``USING_DRIVER`` option (see
information on configuration later in this document), it writes sign-off
messages to the error output file.  For example, one of the following forms of
message

.. code:: text

   n errors detected in the compilation of "ifile".
   1 catastrophic error detected in the compilation of "ifile".
   n errors and 1 catastrophic error detected in the compilation of "ifile".

is written to indicate the detection of errors in the compilation.  No message
is written if no errors were detected.  The following message

.. code:: text

   Error limit reached.

is written when the count of errors reaches the error limit (see the ``-e``
option, above); compilation is then terminated.  The message

.. code:: text

   Compilation terminated.

is written at the end of a compilation that was prematurely terminated because
of a catastrophic error.  The message

.. code:: text

   Compilation aborted.

is written at the end of a compilation that was prematurely terminated because
of an internal error.  Such an error indicates an internal problem in the
compiler and should be reported to those responsible for its maintenance.

Response to Signals
===================

Except in multi-threaded builds, the signals ``SIGINT`` (caused by a user
interrupt, like ``^C``) and ``SIGTERM`` (caused by a ``kill`` command) are
trapped by the front end and cause abnormal termination.  When
``MULTIPLE_THREAD_COMPILATION`` is TRUE, it's expected that the customer
application will install handlers as appropriate and no signal handling is
performed by the front end.

Exit Status
===========

On completion, the front end returns with a code indicating the
highest-severity diagnostic detected: 4 if there was a catastrophic error, 2 if
there were any errors, or 0 if there were any warnings or remarks or if there
were no diagnostics of any kind.

If multiple source files are compiled, the exit status indicates the
highest-severity diagnostic detected in the entire compilation.

.. _finding-includes:

Finding Include Files
=====================

A file name specified in a ``#include`` directive is searched for in a set of
directories specified by command-line options and environment variables.  If
the file name specified does not include a suffix, a set of suffixes is used
when searching for the file.

Files whose names are not absolute pathnames and that are enclosed in ``"..."``
will be searched for in the following directories, in the order listed:

#. The directory containing the current input file (the primary source file
   or the file containing the ``#include``); [#f2]_
#. any directories specified in ``--include_directory`` options (in the
   order in which they were listed on the command line);
#. any directories on the standard list (this list is selected at the time
   of installation of the front end; often, it is just the one directory
   ``/usr/include`` or a similar system include directory for C++).

For file names enclosed in ``<...>``, only the directories that are specified
using the ``--include_directory`` option and those on the standard list are
searched.  If the directory name is specified as "``-``", e.g., "``-I-``", the
option indicates the point in the list of ``--include_directory`` options at
which the search for file names enclosed in ``<...>`` should begin.  That is,
the search for ``<...>`` names should only consider directories named in
``--include_directory`` options following the ``-I-``, and the directories of
item 3 above.  ``-I-`` also removes the directory containing the current input
file (item 1 above) from the search path for file names enclosed in ``"..."``.

An include directory specified with the ``--sys_include`` option is considered
a "system" include directory.  Warnings are suppressed when processing files
found in system include directories.  If a default include directory has been
specified using the ``USR_INCLUDE`` configuration flag or environment variable,
it is considered a system include directory.

If the file name has no suffix it will be searched for by appending each of a
set of include file suffixes.  When searching in a given directory all of the
suffixes are tried in that directory before moving on to the next search
directory.  The default set of suffixes is specified by the
``DEFAULT_INCLUDE_FILE_SUFFIX_LIST`` configuration parameter.  The default can
be overridden using the ``--incl_suffixes`` command-line option.  A null file
suffix cannot be used unless it is present in the suffix list (i.e., the front
end will always attempt to add a suffix from the suffix list when the file name
has no suffix).

.. _finding-modules:

Finding Module Files
====================

An ``import`` directive can specify either a module unit or a header unit, and
the process of finding these differ.  A header unit import names the header
identically to the equivalent ``#include`` directive (a file name enclosed in
``<...>`` or ``"..."``), while a module unit is imported by its name and not
the name of the file containing the module unit.

An ``import`` directive that specifies a header unit first finds the named
header using the process for finding ``#include`` files.  See
:ref:`finding-includes`.  If the header is found, the corresponding module file
is found by the following search, in the listed order:

#. Using the direct mappings provided by ``--ms_header_unit``.
#. Using the unresolved mappings provided by ``--ms_header_unit_angle`` (if
   the header file name is specified via ``<...>``) or by
   ``--ms_header_unit_quote`` (if the header file name is specified via
   ``"..."``).  If a match is found here, that match is added to the map
   for ``--ms_header_unit``.

An ``import`` directive that specifies a module unit will search for the module
file, in the order listed:

#. Any direct mappings from that module name to a module file as specified
   by ``--ms_mod_file_map``
#. Any files listed without a direct map by ``--ms_mod_file_map``, examining
   those files to determine if the module each represents matches the module
   being imported
#. Files in the directory containing the current input file (the primary
   source file or the file containing the ``import``)
#. Files in any directories specified by\ ``--modules_directory`` (in the
   order in which they were listed on the command line)
#. Files in the directory specified by the ``EDG_MODULES_PATH`` environment
   variable, if it's set.

C++ Dialect Accepted
====================

In strict C++ mode, the front end accepts the complete C++ language as defined
by the ISO/IEC 14882:2003 standard, including export templates (if the front
end's configuration allows them).  In nonstrict C++ mode (which is the default
in common configurations), a small set of features -- particularly, export
templates -- are not supported, but some minor extensions commonly available on
other compilers are accepted.

The front end accepts the complete C++17 language as defined by the ISO/IEC
14882:2017 standard (enabled through the command-line option ``--c++17``).  The
front end also fully supports the earlier C++14, C++11, and (as noted above)
C++98/03 versions of the language.  The front end supports most of the features
of the C++20 language as defined by the 14882:2020 standard (enabled through
the command-line option ``--c++20``).  The C++20 features that are not accepted
yet are described below.

Extensive compatibility modes are also available for the Microsoft Visual C++
compilers, the GNU C++ ("GCC") compilers, and the clang C++ compiler.  A more
basic Sun C++ compatibility mode is also implemented.  Only one emulation mode
may be active at a time (but ``--ms_extensions`` or ``--ms_compatibility`` may
be enabled in non-Microsoft emulation modes).

The front end also has a cfront compatibility mode, which duplicates a number
of "features" and bugs of cfront 2.1 and 3.0.x.  Complete compatibility is not
guaranteed or intended -- the mode is there to allow programmers who have
unwittingly used cfront features to continue to compile their existing code.
In particular, if a program gets an error when compiled by cfront, the EDG
front end may produce a different error or no error at all.

Command-line options are available to enable and disable anachronisms, to
control strict standard-conformance checking, and to adjust the severity of
certain diagnostics.



C++20 Implementation Status
---------------------------

Most of the new features and changes in the C++20 standard are accepted by
the front end.  Details about the specific changes (e.g., the first version
of the front end to support the feature, and the standard committee papers
that introduced the feature) can be found on the `EDG website
<http://www.edg.com/c/features>`__.

The following C++20 features are not yet supported (our web site has links with
further details):

* | Concepts are supported, but some of the most recent changes to the feature
    are not yet supported:

  * | Partial ordering of rewritten operator candidates resulting from
      constrained templates
  * | Clarify declaration matching and partial ordering requiring substitution
      into constraints
* | When are ``constexpr`` member functions defined? (core issue 1581).  This
    is not yet implemented because of concerns about potential code breakage.
* | Modules.  (There is partial support for importing Microsoft modules.  See
    the release notes for more information.)

C++23 and C++26 Implementation Status
-------------------------------------

Some of the new features and changes in the C++23 and draft C++26 standard are
accepted by the front end.  Details about the specific changes (e.g., the first
version of the front end to support the feature, and the standard committee
papers that introduced the feature) can be found on the `EDG website
<http://www.edg.com/c/features>`__.

"Default" C++ Mode
------------------

The following extensions are accepted default C++ mode.  Most of these are also
accepted in any other C++ mode that does not diagnose strict ANSI violations as
errors (exceptions are explicitly noted).

* | A ``friend`` declaration for a class may omit the ``class`` keyword:

  .. code:: c++

     class B;
     class A {
       friend B;  // Should be "friend class B"
     };

* | Constants of scalar type may be defined within classes (this is an old
    form; the modern form uses an initialized static data member):

  .. code:: c++

     class A {
       const int size = 10;
       int a[size];
     };

* | In the declaration of a class member, a qualified name may be used:

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
       int A::f();  // Should be int f();
     };

* | If ``ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_ANONYMOUS_UNIONS`` is TRUE, an extension is
    supported to allow an anonymous union to be introduced into a containing
    class by a ``typedef`` name -- it needn't be declared directly, as with a
    true anonymous union.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     typedef union {
       int i, j;
     } U;           // U identifies a reusable anonymous union.
     class A {
       U;           // Okay -- references to A::i and A::j are allowed.
     };

  | In addition, the extension also permits "anonymous classes" and "anonymous
    structs," as long as they have no C++ features (e.g., no static data
    members or member functions and no nonpublic members) and have no nested
    types other than other anonymous classes, structs, or unions.  For
    instance,

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
       struct {
         int i, j;
       };           // Okay -- references to A::i and A::j are allowed.
     };

* | If recognition of the ``restrict`` keyword is enabled, the C99 ``restrict``
    feature is supported in a form extended for C++, which allows ``restrict``
    as a type qualifier for reference and pointer-to-member types and for
    nonstatic member functions.  The set of C++ extensions is described in
    J16/92-0057.
* | If ``IMPL_CONV_BETWEEN_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_PTRS_POSSIBLE`` is TRUE, implicit
    type conversion between a pointer to an ``extern "C"`` function and a
    pointer to an ``extern "C++"`` function is permitted.  Here's an example:

  .. code:: c++

     extern "C" void f();     // f's type has extern "C" linkage
     void (*pf)()             // pf points to an extern "C++" function
                  = &f;       // error unless implicit conversion is allowed

  | This extension is allowed in environments where C and C++ functions share
    the same calling conventions (though it is pointless unless
    ``DEFAULT_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_TYPES_ARE_DISTINCT`` is TRUE).  When
    ``DEFAULT_IMPL_CONV_BETWEEN_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_PTRS_ALLOWED`` is set, it is
    enabled by default; it can also be enabled in cfront-compatibility mode or
    with command-line option ``--implicit_extern_c_type_conversion``.
* | A "``?``" operator whose second and third operands are string literals or
    wide string literals can be implicitly converted to "``char *``" or
    "``wchar_t *``".  (Recall that in C++ string literals are ``const``.  There
    is a deprecated implicit conversion that allows conversion of a string
    literal to "``char *``", dropping the ``const``.  That conversion, however,
    applies only to simple string literals.  Allowing it for the result of a
    "``?``" operation is an extension.)

  .. code:: c++

     char *p = x ? "abc" : "def";

* | Default arguments may be specified for function parameters other than those
    of a top-level function declaration (e.g., they are accepted on ``typedef``
    declarations and on pointer-to-function and pointer-to-member-function
    declarations).
* | Nonstatic local variables of an enclosing function can be referenced in a
    non-evaluated expression (e.g., a ``sizeof`` expression) inside a local
    class.  A warning is issued.
* | In default C++ mode (but not other non-C++11 modes), the friend class
    syntax is extended to allow nonclass types as well as class types expressed
    through a typedef or without an elaborated type name.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     typedef struct S ST;
     class C {
       friend S;             // Okay (requires S to be in scope).
       friend ST;            // Okay (same as "friend S;").
       friend int;           // Okay (no effect).
       friend S const;       // Error: cv-qualifiers cannot appear directly.
     };

* | In default C++ mode, mixed string literal concatenations are accepted.
    (This is a feature carried over from C99 and also available in GNU modes.
    It is not enabled in other non-C++11 modes.)

  .. code:: c++

     wchar_t *str = "a" L"b";  // Okay, same as L"ab".

* | In default C++ mode, variadic macros are accepted.  (This is a feature
    carried over from C99 and also available in GNU modes.  It is not by
    default enabled in other non-C++11 modes.)
* | In default C++ mode, empty macro arguments are accepted (a feature carried
    over from C99).
* | A trailing comma in the definition of an enumeration type is silently
    accepted (a feature carried over from C99):

  .. code:: c++

     enum E { e, };

Except where noted, all of the extensions described in the C dialect section
are also allowed in C++ mode.

.. _gnu-mode:

GNU C++ Mode
------------

The front end can be built to accept GNU extensions.  In GNU C++ mode, a large
number of extensions and bugs are closely emulated.  This feature enables the
front end to compile many large and complex projects that were developed using
the GNU tool chain; this includes major open-source projects.

Support for this emulation is ongoing: New GNU C++ features are added as
needed, with priority given to features used in system headers.

Because the GNU compiler frequently changes behavior between releases, the
front end provides an option (``--gnu_version``) to specify a specific version
of GCC to emulate.  Generally speaking, features and bugs are emulated to
exactly match each known version of GCC, but occasionally the emulation is
approximate and in such cases the front end is often a little more permissive
than GCC on the principle that it is more important to accept source that GCC
accepts than to diagnose every case that GCC diagnoses.  The front end does
not, however, attempt to emulate every GCC command-line option; in particular,
GCC options to be extra-permissive are not emulated (however, the severity of
specific error diagnostics can sometimes be decreased to accept constructs that
are not by-default allowed in GNU emulation mode).

Some GNU features are only emulated when specific configuration options are
enabled.  For example, support for complex floating-point types is only
available when the front end is configured to support C99 extensions.

A few GCC extensions there are likely *not* going to be supported in the
foreseeable future:

* | The forward declaration of function parameters (so they can participate in
    variable-length array parameters).
* | GNU-style complex *integral* types (complex *floating-point* types are
    supported)
* | Nested functions
* | Local structs with variable-length array fields.  Such fields are treated
    (with a warning) as zero-length arrays in GNU C mode, which is a useful
    approximation in some circumstances, but not generally equivalent to the
    GNU feature.

Microsoft C++ Mode
------------------

The front end also extensively emulates the Microsoft Visual C++ compilers.  As
is the case with GNU modes, an option (``--microsoft_version``) is available to
select a specific version of Microsoft's compiler to emulate.

Although Microsoft C++ and C modes generally emulate both extensions/features
and bugs, the emulation of a certain class of bugs (considered more severe) can
be controlled separately (using the ``--no_microsoft_bugs/--microsoft_bugs``
options).

Microsoft C++ mode can be combined with certain other language options to
enable a larger superset of the language accepted by the Microsoft compiler.

In addition to full Microsoft emulation mode, two subsets of Microsoft
emulation are available: ``--ms_extensions``, and ``--ms_compatibility``,
corresponding to clang's ``-fms-extensions`` and ``-fms-compatibility``
command-line options, respectively.  These command-line options allow a certain
degree of Microsoft emulation while the primary emulation mode is something
else (e.g., ``--clang``).

Support for Microsoft C++ emulation is ongoing: New features are added as
needed, with priority given to features used in system headers.

Microsoft C++/CLI Mode
----------------------

The front end implements the language extensions known as "C++/CLI" that
simplifies writing C++-like programs for Microsoft's ".NET" environment.  These
extensions are formally described through the ECMA-372 standard, but where the
Microsoft compiler deviates from the standard, the front end follows the
Microsoft compiler rather than the standard.

Almost all C++/CLI features are implemented in the front end.  This includes
various managed class kinds and the special members (e.g.,  properties) that
they can contain, delegates, handles and tracking references, ``gcnew``,
generics, importing of assemblies, hide-by-sig lookup rules, string literal
rules, and so forth.  A notable exception is Microsoft-style attributes
(delimited by square brackets): The front end can parse them, but does not
currently implement their semantics.

An earlier attempt at integrating C++ and .NET was known as "Managed C++": The
front end does not support those earlier Microsoft compiler features (which
have since been deprecated by Microsoft).

Extensions Accepted in Sun Compatibility Mode
---------------------------------------------

The front end provides a "Sun Compatibility" mode.  This mode automatically
selects a set of command-line options that provides the greatest compatibility
with the Sun CC 5.x compiler.  It also enables certain extensions that are
accepted by the Sun compiler.  Note that this mode is provided to enable the
front end to compile code such as commonly used Sun header files, and is not
intended to provide complete compatibility with the Sun compiler.

Sun compatibility mode currently corresponds to the following combination of
options:

.. code:: text

   --no_guiding_decls
   --extern_inline
   --nonstd_using_decl

These settings can explicitly be overridden using more command-line options.

The following extensions are accepted in Sun compatibility mode:

* | The Sun-specific link scope specifiers ``__global``, ``__symbolic``, and
    ``__hidden`` can be recognized.  In modes that recognize these keywords,
    the pragmas "``#pragma disable_ldscope``" and "``#pragma enable_ldscope``"
    can be used to temporarily allow these keywords as normal identifiers.  For
    example:

  .. code:: c++

     __global int i;       // Accepted in some Sun modes.
     #pragma disable_ldscope
     int __global;         // Okay: Keyword (temporarily) deactivated.
     #pragma enable_ldscope
     struct __global;      // Error: __global is a keyword.

* | The ``__thread`` specifier can be used to indicate that a variable should
    be placed in thread-local storage.
* | In Sun mode, a non-tag from one scope hides a tag from another scope when
    both are visible as a result of a using-directive.

  .. code:: c++

     template <class T> struct B { };
     namespace N {
       typedef B<char> A;
     }
     using namespace N;
     class A;typedef A C;   // Sun mode uses typedef N::A instead of ambiguity

* | A reference to an undeclared function template is accepted when the
    reference appears in the definition of a class template.

  .. code:: c++

     template <class T> struct A {
       friend void f<>(T&);  // Accepted in Sun mode
     };

* | When a friend class is declared with an unqualified name, the lookup of
    that name is not restricted to the nearest enclosing namespace scope.

  .. code:: c++

       struct S;
       namespace N {
         class C {
           friend struct S;  // ::S in Sun and Microsoft modes
         };
                             // (N::S otherwise)
       }

* | The ``typename`` keyword is ignored in most contexts.

  .. code:: c++

     // The Sun compiler does recognize typename in a template parameter list
     template <typename T> class C {
       // Illegal uses of typename that are accepted by the Sun compiler
       typename T t;
       typename typename T typename typename x;
     };

* | A default argument may be specified in the definition of a member function
    of a class template declared outside of the class.

  .. code:: c++

     template <class T> struct A {
       void f(int);
     };
     template <class T> void A<T>::f(int = 0) { }

* | A template argument list may appear following a constructor name in
    constructor definition that appears outside of the class definition:

  .. code:: c++

     template <class T> struct A {
       A();
     };
     template <class T> A<T>::A<T>(){}

* | Template parameters are (incorrectly) visible in class template
    specializations and specializations of members of class templates.

  .. code:: c++

     template <class T> struct A {
       void f();
     };
     template <> struct A<int> {
       T t;  // T should not be visible here
     };
     template <> void A<char>::f() {
       T t;  // T should not be visible here
     }

* | The explicit instantiation of a class does not cause the instantiation of
    its inline members.

   .. code:: c++

     template <class T> struct A {
       void f() {
         g();
       } // Not instantiated in Sun mode
     };
     template class A<int>;

* | An ``extern inline`` function that is referenced but not defined is
    permitted (with a warning).
* | Default arguments are retained as part of deduced function types.
* | When searching for a header file specified using the ``<...>`` syntax, the
    front end searches for the specified header file name and also for a
    version with the suffix ``.SUNWCCh`` appended (e.g., ``stddef.h.SUNWCCh``).
* | The ``std`` namespace is predeclared.
* | A reference to a nonstatic data member may be written without an object
    (not even an implicit ``this->``) inside a sizeof:

  .. code:: c++

     typedef struct _X {
       char A[512];
     } X;
     static unsigned int foo() {
       return sizeof(X::A);
     }

* | A storage class may appear in a declaration that also has a "direct"
    linkage specification -- e.g.,

  .. code:: c++

     extern "s" static void f();

  | is treated as equivalent to

  .. code:: c++

     extern "C" { static void f(); }

Anachronisms Accepted
---------------------

The following anachronisms are accepted when anachronisms are enabled:

* | ``overload`` is allowed in function declarations.  It is accepted and
    ignored.
* | Definitions are not required for static data members that can be
    initialized using default initialization.  The anachronism does not apply
    to static data members of template classes; they must always be defined.
* | The number of elements in an array may be specified in an array ``delete``
    operation.  The value is ignored.
* | A single ``operator++()`` and ``operator--()`` function can be used to
    overload both prefix and postfix operations.
* | The base class name may be omitted in a base class initializer if there is
    only one immediate base class.
* | Assignment to ``this`` in constructors and destructors is allowed.  This is
    allowed only if anachronisms are enabled and the "assignment to ``this``"
    configuration parameter is enabled.
* | A bound function pointer (a pointer to a member function for a given
    object) can be cast to a pointer to a function.
* | A nested class name may be used as a nonnested class name provided no other
    class of that name has been declared.  The anachronism is not applied to
    template classes.
* | A reference to a non-const type may be initialized from a value of a
    different type.  A temporary is created, it is initialized from the
    (converted) initial value, and the reference is set to the temporary.
* | A reference to a non-const class type may be initialized from an rvalue of
    the class type or a derived class thereof.  No (additional) temporary is
    used.
* | A function with old-style parameter declarations is allowed and may
    participate in function overloading as though it were prototyped.  Default
    argument promotion is not applied to parameter types of such functions when
    the check for compatibility is done, so that the following declares the
    overloading of two functions named ``f``:

  .. code:: c++

     int f(int);
     int f(x) char x; { return x; }

  | It will be noted that in C this code is legal but has a different
    meaning: a tentative declaration of ``f`` is followed by its definition.
* | When ``--nonconst_ref_anachronism`` is enabled, a reference to a nonconst
    class can be bound to a class rvalue of the same type or a derived type
    thereof.

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
       A(int);
       A operator=(A&);
       A operator+(const A&);
     };
     main () {
       A b(1);
       b = A(1) + A(2);   // Allowed as anachronism
     }

Extensions Accepted in Cfront 2.1 Compatibility Mode
----------------------------------------------------

The following extensions are accepted in cfront 2.1 compatibility mode in
addition to the extensions listed in the 2.1/3.0 section following (i.e., these
are things that were corrected in the 3.0 release of cfront):

* | The dependent statement of an ``if``, ``while``, ``do``-``while``, or
    ``for`` is not considered to define a scope.  The dependent statement may
    not be a declaration.  Any objects constructed within the dependent
    statement are destroyed at exit from the dependent statement.
* | Implicit conversion from integral types to enumeration types is allowed.
* | A non-``const`` member function may be called for a ``const`` object.  A
    warning is issued.
* | A ``const void *`` value may be implicitly converted to a ``void *`` value,
    e.g., when passed as an argument.
* | When, in determining the level of argument match for overloading, a
    reference parameter is initialized from an argument that requires a
    non-class standard conversion, the conversion counts as a user-defined
    conversion.  (This is an outright bug, which unfortunately happens to be
    exploited in the NIH class libraries.)
* | When a builtin operator is considered alongside overloaded operators in
    overload resolution, the match of an operand of a builtin type against the
    builtin type required by the builtin operator is considered a standard
    conversion in all cases (e.g., even when the type is exactly right without
    conversion).
* | A reference to a non-``const`` type may be initialized from a value that is
    a ``const``-qualified version of the same type, but only if the value is
    the result of selecting a member from a ``const`` class object or a pointer
    to such an object.
* | The cfront 2.1 "transitional model" for nested type support is simulated.
    In the transitional model a nested type is promoted to the file scope
    unless a type of the same name already exists at the file scope.  It is an
    error to have two nested classes of the same name that need to be promoted
    to file scope or to define a type at file scope after the declaration of a
    nested class of the same name.  This "feature" actually restricts the
    source language accepted by the compiler.  This is necessary because of the
    effect this feature has on the name mangling of functions that use nested
    types in their signature.  This feature does not apply to template classes
    and is only enabled when the configuration switch
    ``CFRONT_2_1_OBJECT_CODE_COMPATIBILITY`` is TRUE.
* | A cast to an array type is allowed; it is treated like a cast to a pointer
    to the array element type.  A warning is issued.
* | When an array is selected from a class, the type qualifiers on the class
    object (if any) are not preserved in the selected array.  (In the normal
    mode, any type qualifiers on the object are preserved in the element type
    of the resultant array.)
* | An identifier in a function is allowed to have the same name as a parameter
    of the function.  A warning is issued.
* | An expression of type ``void`` may be supplied on the return statement in a
    function with a ``void`` return type.  A warning is issued.
* | Cfront has a bug that causes a global identifier to be found when a member
    of a class or one of its base classes should actually be found.  This bug
    is emulated in cfront compatibility mode but can be disabled by setting the
    parameter ``CFRONT_GLOBAL_VS_MEMBER_NAME_LOOKUP_BUG`` to FALSE.  A
    warning is issued when, because of this feature, a nonstandard lookup is
    performed.
  |
  | The following conditions must be satisfied for the nonstandard lookup to be
    performed:

  * | A member in a base class must have the same name as an identifier at the
      global scope.  The member may be a function, static data member, or
      nonstatic data member.  Member type names don't apply because a nested
      type will be promoted to the global scope by cfront which disallows a
      later declaration of a type with the same name at the global scope.
  * | The declaration of the global scope name must occur between the
      declaration of the derived class and the declaration of an out-of-line
      constructor or destructor.  The global scope name must be a type name.
  * | No other member function definition -- even one for an unrelated class
      -- may appear between the destructor and the offending reference.
      This has the effect that the nonstandard lookup applies to only one
      class at any given point in time.  For example:

    .. code:: c++

     struct B {
       void func(const char*);
     };
     struct D : public B {
     public:
       D();
       void Init(const char* );
     };
     struct func {
       func( const char* msg);
     };
     D::D(){}
     void D::Init(const char* t){
       // Should call B::func --  calls func::func instead.
       new func(t);
     }

  | The global scope name must be present in a base class (``B::func`` in this
    example) for the nonstandard lookup to occur.  Even if the derived class
    were to have a member named ``func``, it is still the presence of
    ``B::func`` that determines how the lookup will be performed.
* | A parameter of type "``const void *``" is allowed on ``operator delete``;
    it is treated as equivalent to "``void *``".
* | A period ("``.``") may be used for qualification where "``::``" should be
    used.  Only "``::``" may be used as a global qualifier.  Except for the
    global qualifier, the two kinds of qualifier operators may not be mixed in
    a given name (i.e., you may say ``A::B::C`` or ``A.B.C`` but not ``A::B.C``
    or ``A.B::C``).  A period may not be used in a vacuous destructor reference
    nor in a qualifier that follows a template reference such as ``A<T>::B``.
* | Cfront 2.1 does not correctly look up names in friend functions that are
    inside class definitions.  In this example function f should refer to the
    functions and variables (e.g., ``f1`` and ``a1``) from the class
    declaration.  Instead, the global definitions are used.

  .. code:: c++

     int a1;
     int e1;
     void f1();
     class A {
       int a1;
       void f1();
       friend void f()  {
         int i1 = a1;   // cfront uses global a1
         f1();          // cfront uses global f1
       }
     };

  | Only the innermost class scope is (incorrectly) skipped by cfront
    as illustrated in the following example.

  .. code:: c++

     int a1;
     int b1;
     struct A {
       static int a1;
       class B {
         static int b1;
         friend void f() {
           int i1 = a1;  // cfront uses A::a1
           int j1 = b1;  // cfront uses global b1
         }
       };
     };

* | ``operator=`` may be declared as a nonmember function.  (This is flagged as
    an anachronism by cfront 2.1)
* | A type qualifier is allowed (but ignored) on the declaration of a
    constructor or destructor.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     class A {
       A() const;   // No error in cfront 2.1 mode
     };

* | The preprocessing symbol ``c_plusplus`` is defined in addition to the
    standard ``__cplusplus``.

Extensions Accepted in Cfront 2.1 and 3.0 Compatibility Mode
------------------------------------------------------------

The following extensions are accepted in both cfront 2.1 and cfront 3.0
compatibility mode (i.e., these are features or problems that exist in both
cfront 2.1 and 3.0):

* | Type qualifiers on the ``this`` parameter may be dropped in contexts
    such as this example:

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
       void f() const;
     };
     void (A::*fp)() = &A::f;

  | This is actually a safe operation.  A pointer to a ``const`` function may
    be put into a pointer to non-``const``, because a call using the pointer is
    permitted to modify the object and the function pointed to will actually
    not modify the object.  The opposite assignment would not be safe.
* | Conversion operators specifying conversion to ``void`` are allowed.
* | A nonstandard friend declaration may introduce a new type.  A friend
    declaration that omits the elaborated type specifier is allowed in default
    mode, but in cfront mode the declaration is also allowed to introduce a new
    type name.

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
        friend B;
     };

* | The third operand of the ``?`` operator is a conditional expression instead
    of an assignment expression as it is in the modern language.
* | A reference to a pointer type may be initialized from a pointer value
    without use of a temporary even when the reference pointer type has
    additional type qualifiers above those present in the pointer value.  For
    example,

  .. code:: c++

     int *p;
     const int *&r = p;  // No temporary used

* | A reference may be initialized with a null.
* | Because cfront does not check the accessibility of types, access errors for
    types are issued as warnings instead of errors.
* | When matching arguments of an overloaded function, a ``const`` variable
    with value zero is not considered to be a null pointer constant.  In
    general, in overload resolution a null pointer constant must be spelled
    "``0``" to be considered a null pointer constant (e.g., ``'\0'`` is not
    considered a null pointer constant).
* | Inside the definition of a class type, the qualifier in the declarator for
    a member declaration is dropped if that qualifier names the class being
    defined.

  .. code:: c++

     struct S {
       void S::f(); // No warning in cfront mode
     };

* | An alternate form of declaring pointer-to-member-function variables is
    supported, namely:

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
       void f(int);
       static void sf(int);
       typedef void A::T3(int);  // nonstd typedef decl
       typedef void T2(int);     // std typedef
     };
     typedef void A::T(int);   // nonstd typedef decl
     T* pmf = &A::f;           // nonstd ptr-to-member decl
     A::T2* pf = A::sf;        // std ptr to static mem decl
     A::T3* pmf2 = &A::f;      // nonstd ptr-to-member decl

  | where ``T`` is construed to name a routine type for a nonstatic member
    function of class ``A`` that takes an ``int`` argument and returns
    ``void``; the use of such types is restricted to nonstandard
    pointer-to-member declarations.  The declarations of ``T`` and ``pmf`` in
    combination are equivalent to a single standard pointer-to-member
    declaration:

  .. code:: c++

     void (A::* pmf)(int) = &A::f;

  | A nonstandard pointer-to-member declaration that appears outside of a class
    declaration, such as the declaration of ``T``, is normally invalid and
    would cause an error to be issued.  However, for declarations that appear
    within a class declaration, such as ``A::T3``, this feature changes the
    meaning of a valid declaration.  cfront version 2.1 accepts declarations,
    such as ``T``, even when ``A`` is an incomplete type; so this case is also
    excepted.
* | Protected member access checking is not done when the address of a
    protected member is taken.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     class B { protected: int i; };
     class D : public B { void mf(); };
     void D::mf() {
       int B::* pmi1 = &B::i;  // error, OK in cfront mode
       int D::* pmi2 = &D::i;  // OK
     }

  | Note that protected member access checking for other operations (i.e.,
    everything except taking a pointer-to-member address) is done in the normal
    manner.
* | The destructor of a derived class may implicitly call the private
    destructor of a base class.  In default mode this is an error but in cfront
    mode it is reduced to a warning.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     class A {
       ~A();
     };
     class B : public A {
       ~B();
     };
     B::~B(){}      // Error except in cfront mode

* | When disambiguation requires deciding whether something is a parameter
    declaration or an argument expression, the pattern *type-name-or-keyword*\
    ``(``\ *identifier*...  ``)`` is treated as an argument.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     class A {
       A();
     };
     double d;
     A x(int(d));
     A(x2);

  | By default ``int(d)`` is interpreted as a parameter declaration (with
    redundant parentheses), and so ``x`` is a function; but in
    cfront-compatibility mode ``int(d)`` is an argument and ``x`` is a
    variable.
  | The declaration ``A(x2);`` is also misinterpreted by cfront.  It should be
    interpreted as the declaration of an object named ``x2``, but in cfront
    mode is interpreted as a function style cast of ``x2`` to the type ``A``.
  | Similarly, the declaration

  .. code:: c++

     int xyz(int());

  | declares a function named ``xyz``, that takes a parameter of type "function
    taking no arguments and returning an ``int``." In cfront mode this is
    interpreted as a declaration of an object that is initialized with the
    value ``int()`` (which evaluates to zero).
* | A named bit-field may have a size of zero.  The declaration is treated as
    though no name had been declared.
* | Plain bit fields (i.e., bit fields declared with a type of ``int``) are
    always unsigned.
* | The name given in an elaborated type specifier is permitted to be a
    ``typedef`` name that is the synonym for a class name, e.g.,

  .. code:: c++

     typedef class A T;
     class T *pa;   // No error in cfront mode

* | No warning is issued on duplicate size and sign specifiers.

  .. code:: c++

     short short int i;    // No warning in cfront mode

* | An extra comma is allowed after the last argument in an argument list, as
    for example in

  .. code:: c++

     f(1, 2, );

* | A constant pointer-to-member-function may be cast to a pointer-to-function.
    A warning is issued.

  .. code:: c++

     struct A {
       int f();
     };
     main () {
       int (*p)();
       p = (int (*)())A::f;  // Okay, with warning
     }

* | Arguments of class types that allow bitwise copy construction but also have
    destructors are passed by value (i.e., like C structures), and the
    destructor is not called on the "copy." In normal mode, the class object is
    copied into a temporary, the address of the temporary is passed as the
    argument, and the destructor is called on the temporary after the call
    returns.  Note that because the argument is passed differently (by value
    instead of by address), code like this compiled in cfront mode is not
    calling-sequence compatible with the same code compiled in normal mode.  In
    practice, this is not much of a problem, since classes that allow bitwise
    copying usually do not have destructors.
* | A union member may be declared to have the type of a class for which the
    user has defined an assignment operator (as long as the class has no
    constructor or destructor).  A warning is issued.
* | When an unnamed class appears in a ``typedef`` declaration, the ``typedef``
    name may appear as the class name in an elaborated type specifier.

  .. code:: c++

     typedef struct {
      int i, j;
     } S;
     struct S x;     // No error in cfront mode

* | Two member functions may be declared with the same parameter types when one
    is static and the other is nonstatic with a function qualifier.

  .. code:: c++

     class A {
       void f(int) const;
       static void f(int);     // No error in cfront mode
     };

* | The scope of a variable declared in the ``for-init-statement`` is the scope
    to which the ``for`` statement belongs.

  .. code:: c++

     int f(int i) {
       for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) { /* ... */ }
       return j;     // No error in cfront mode
     }

* | Function types differing only in that one is declared ``extern "C"`` and
    the other ``extern "C++"`` can be treated as identical:

  .. code:: c++

     typedef void (*PF)();
     extern "C" typedef void (*PCF)();
     void f(PF);
     void f(PCF);

  | When ``DEFAULT_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_TYPES_ARE_DISTINCT`` is FALSE, ``PF`` and
    ``PCF`` are considered identical and ``void f(PCF)`` is treated as a
    compatible redeclaration of ``f``.  (By contrast, in standard C++``PF`` and
    ``PCF`` are different and incompatible types -- ``PF`` is a pointer to an
    ``extern "C++"`` function whereas ``PCF`` is a pointer to an ``extern "C"``
    function -- and the two declarations of ``f`` create an overload set.)
  |
  | However, even if ``DEFAULT_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_TYPES_ARE_DISTINCT`` is TRUE,
    it is possible to set
    ``IMPL_CONV_BETWEEN_C_AND_CPP_FUNCTION_PTRS_POSSIBLE`` to TRUE as well, so
    that in cfront-compatibility mode an implicit type conversion will always
    be done between a pointer to an ``extern "C"`` function and a pointer to an
    ``extern "``\ C++``"`` function.
* | Functions declared ``inline`` have internal linkage.
* | ``enum`` types are regarded as integral types.
* | An uninitialized ``const`` object of non-POD class type is allowed even if
    its default constructor is implicitly declared:

  .. code:: c++

     struct A { virtual void f(); int i; };
     const A a;

* | A function parameter type is allowed to involve a pointer or reference to
    array of unknown bounds.
* | If the user declares an ``operator=`` function in a class, but not one that
    can serve as the default ``operator=``, and bitwise assignment could be
    done on the class, a default ``operator=`` is not generated; only the
    user-written ``operator=`` functions are considered for assignments (and
    therefore bitwise assignment is not done).
* | A member function declaration whose return type is omitted (and thus
    implicitly ``int``) and whose name is found to be that of a type is
    accepted if it takes no parameters:

  .. code:: c++

     typedef int I;
     struct S {
       I();    // Accepted in cfront mode (declares "int S::I()")
       I(int); // Not accepted
     };

* | Default arguments are retained as part of deduced function types.

C Dialect Accepted
==================

The front end accepts the ANSI/ISO C language as defined by ANSI/ISO
9899:1990.  In C99 mode, it accepts the ANSI/ISO C language defined by
ISO/IEC 9899:1999 as modified by Technical Corrigenda 1 through 3.  In C11
mode, it accepts the C language defined by ISO/IEC 9899:2011 and in C18
mode the language defined by ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (which only differs from C11
in minor ways).  In C23 mode, many of the features of the latest standard
have been implemented.  See the `EDG web site
<https://www.edg.com/c/features>`__ for up-to-date information about
feature implementation.

When Embedded C extensions are enabled, the front end can accept the constructs
described in ISO/IEC TR 18037 (fixed-point types, named address space
qualifiers, and named-register storage class specifiers).

The front end extensively emulates the C modes of the Microsoft, GNU, and clang
compilers.  See :ref:`gnu-mode`.  As with C++ mode, only one emulation mode may
be in effect for a given compilation.  The ``--ms_extensions`` and
``--ms_compatibility`` options can be used to emulate certain Microsoft
behaviors irrespective of the emulation mode.

There is no Sun C mode corresponding to Sun C++ mode, however.

The special comments recognized by the UNIX ``lint`` program --
``/*ARGSUSED*/``, ``/*VARARGS*/`` (with or without a count of non-varying
arguments), and ``/*NOTREACHED*/`` -- are also recognized by the front end.

When Unified Parallel C (UPC) mode is enabled, it also accepts the core
language extensions described in `version 1.0 of the UPC Language
Specifications <http://upc.gwu.edu>`__).

C99 Features Available in Other Modes
-------------------------------------

Certain C language features were added in the C99 version of the ISO C standard
and are supported in C99 mode.  For a full list of those features, see ISO/IEC
9899:1999.  A few features are noteworthy, however, because they are
implementation-specific or because they can be enabled in older C modes or
(when indicated) in C++ mode:

* | The options ``--variadic_macros``, ``--no_variadic_macros``,
    ``--extended_variadic_macros`` and ``--no_extended_variadic_macros``
    control whether macros taking a variable number of arguments are
    recognized.  Configuration flags are available to select the default
    setting of these options; these are also available in C++ mode.
  | Ordinary variadic macros (as included in C99) are illustrated by the
    following example:

  .. code:: c++

     #define OVM(x, ...) x(__VA_ARGS__)
     void f() { OVM(printf, "%s %d\n", "Three args for ", 1); }
     /* Expands to: printf("%s %d\n", "Three args for ", 1) */

  | During expansion the special identifier ``__VA_ARGS__`` will be replaced by
    the trailing arguments of the macro invocation.  If variadic macros are
    enabled, this special identifier can appear only in the replacement list of
    variadic macros.
  | Extended variadic macros (as implemented by certain pre-C99 compilers) use
    a slightly different syntax and allow the name of the variadic parameter to
    be chosen (instead of ``...``/``__VA_ARGS__``):

  .. code:: c++

     #define EVM(x, args...) x(args)
     void f() { EVM(printf, "%s %d\n", "Three args for ", 1); }
     /* Same expansion as previous example. */

  | In addition, enabling extended variadic macros adds a special behavior to
    the token pasting operator ## when it is followed by an empty or omitted
    macro argument: A preceding comma (possibly followed by white space) is
    erased.  Hence,

  .. code:: c++

     #define EVM2(fmt, args) printf(fmt , ## args)
     EVM2("Hello World\n")

  | expands to ``printf("Hello World\n")`` and the extraneous comma is erased.
* | If the ``LONG_LONG_ALLOWED`` switch is TRUE,

  * | the ``long long`` and ``unsigned long long`` types are accepted;
  * | integer constants suffixed by ``LL`` are given the type ``long long``,
      and those suffixed by ``ULL`` are given the type ``unsigned long long``
      (any of the suffix letters may be written in lower case);
  * | the specifier ``%lld`` is recognized in ``printf`` and ``scanf``
      formatting strings; and
  * | the ``long long`` types are accommodated in the usual arithmetic
      conversions.
* | ``restrict`` may be used as a type qualifier for object pointer types and
    function parameter arrays that decay to pointers.  Its presence is recorded
    in the IL so that back ends can perform optimizations that would otherwise
    be prevented because of possible aliasing.  The keyword is enabled by
    ``--restrict``; this is also available in C++.
* | If ``VLA_ALLOWED`` is TRUE, variable length arrays (VLAs) are supported.
    VLA types may appear only in the declaration of an identifier that belongs
    to a block or function-prototype scope.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     void addscalar(int n, int m, double a[n][m], double x) {
       int i, j;
       for (i=0; i<n; i++)
         for (j=0; j<m, j++)
           a[i][j] += x;
             /* a refers to a VLA with n*m elements. */
     }
     double A[4][8];
     void f() {
       addscalar(4, 8, A, 3.14);
     }

  | See also command line options ``--vla`` and ``--no_vla``.
* | When ``DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER_ENABLING_POSSIBLE`` is TRUE, designators may
    be accepted in initializers for aggregates.  Designators are not allowed in
    C++ mode, however.  The global variables ``designators_allowed`` and
    ``extended_designators_allowed`` are controlled by configuration flags and
    command line options.  In turn they control which variety (if any) of
    designators is recognized.  See also command line options
    ``--designators``, ``--no_designators``, ``--extended_designators`` and
    ``--no_extended_designators``.
  | When ``designators_allowed`` is TRUE, designators of the forms ``.x`` and
    ``[k]`` are accepted.  They can be concatenated to reach nested aggregate
    elements.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     struct X { double a; int b[10] } x
                             = { .b = { 1, [5] = 2 }, .b[3] = 1, .a = 42.0 };

  | In addition, when ``extended_designators_allowed`` is TRUE, designators of
    the form ``x:`` and ``[m ...  n]`` are accepted and the assignment (``=``)
    token becomes optional after array element designators.  Field designators
    of the form ``x:`` cannot immediately be followed by an assignment token
    (``=``) or another designator.  Examples:

  .. code:: c++

     struct X { double a; int b[10] } x
                             = { b: { 1, [5 ... 9] = 2 }, .b[7] 1, a: 42.0 };
     struct Y y = { b:[3] /* Error */ = 7, a: = /* Error */ 42.0 };

  | Designators permit multiple initializations of the same subobject: only the
    last value is retained, but side-effects of prior initializing expressions
    do occur.
* | Compound literals are supported in expressions.  For example,

  .. code:: c++

     int *p = (int []){1, 2, 3};

  | creates an unnamed lvalue of type ``int[3]`` initialized as indicated.
    ``p`` is initialized to point to that array.  Compound literals are not
    allowed in C++ mode.
* | The ``__generic`` pseudo-macro is implemented.  This is an EDG extension
    used to support the type-generic math header ``<tgmath.h>.`` The form of
    the macro reference is:

  .. code:: c++

        __generic(x, y, z, func_d, func_f, func_l, func_cd, func_cf, func_cl)

  | where ``x`` and the optional ``y`` and ``z`` are the arguments with which a
    type-generic function is called, and the remaining 6 arguments are the
    names of functions from which is selected the actual function to be called.
    The suffixes with which the function names are supplied here correspond to
    function parameter types of ``double``, ``floa``\ t, ``long double``,
    ``double _Complex``, ``float _Complex``, and ``long double _Complex``,
    respectively.  The order is fixed.  Function names may be omitted.  For
    example, ``<tgmath.h>`` may have the following macros defined:

  .. code:: c++

      #define sin(x)  __generic(x,,,  sin, sinf, sinl, csin, csinf,csinl)(x)
      #define fmax(x,y) __generic(x, y,,fmax, fmaxf, fmaxl,,,)(x, y)
      #define conjg(x)  __generic(x,,,  ,,, conjg, conjgf, conjgl)(x)

  | Note that ``sin`` and ``conjg`` take only one argument, that ``fmax`` has
    no forms that accept complex arguments, and that ``conjg`` has no forms
    that accept real arguments.
  | There is also a ``__genericfx`` pseudo-macro that provides a similar
    capability for fixed-point types.  The form of the macro reference is:

  .. code:: c++

     __genericfx(x, fnc_hr, fnc_uhr, fnc_r, fnc_ur, fnc_lr, fnc_ulr,
                   fnc_hk, fnc_uhk, fnc_k, fnc_uk, fnc_lk, fnc_ulk)

  | where ``x`` is as above and the remaining 12 arguments are the names of
    functions, with the suffixes corresponding to function parameter types of
    ``short``\ ``_Fract``, ``unsigned``\ ``short``\ ``_Fract``, ``_Fract``,
    ``unsigned``\ ``_Fract``, ``long``\ ``_Fract``, ``unsigned``\ ``long``\
    ``_Fract``, ``short``\ ``_Accum``, ``unsigned``\ ``short``\ ``_Accum``,
    ``_Accum``, ``unsigned`` _Accum, ``long``\ ``_Accum``, ``unsigned``\
    ``long``\ ``_Accum``, respectively.
* | The keywords ``__I__``, ``__NAN__``, and ``__INFINITY__`` are defined as,
    respectively, a float _Imaginary *i*, a float Not-a-Number, and a float
    positive Infinity.  These are intended to be used by library writers to
    implement the C99 macros ``I``, ``NAN``, and ``INFINITY``.  ``__NAN__`` and
    ``__INFINITY__`` are also available in all modes, not just C99 mode.
* | A trailing array member of unspecified length in a struct type is called a
    flexible array member.  Such members are a standard feature in C99.  In
    default C99 mode (but not in strict C99 mode) trailing struct members can
    also have a type containing a flexible array member.  For example:

  .. code:: c++

     struct F {
       int i;
       int f[];  // OK in default and strict C99 modes
     };
     struct X {
       F x;  // OK in default C99 mode (but not in strict mode)
     };

ANSI C Extensions
-----------------

The following extensions are accepted (these are flagged if the ``-A`` or
``-a`` option is specified):

* | A translation unit (input file) can contain no declarations.
* | Comment text can appear at the ends of preprocessing directives.
* | ``__ALIGNOF__`` (or ``__alignof__``) is similar to ``sizeof``, but returns
    the alignment requirement value for a type, or ``1`` if there is no
    alignment requirement.  It may be followed by a type or expression in
    parentheses:

       ``__ALIGNOF__(``\ *type*\ ``)        __alignof__(``\ *type*\ ``)``

       ``__ALIGNOF__(``\ *expression*\ ``)  __alignof__(``\ *expression*\ ``)``

  | The expression in the second form is not evaluated.
* | ``__INTADDR__(``\ *expression*\ ``)`` scans the enclosed expression as a
    constant expression, and converts it to an integer constant (it is used in
    the ``offsetof`` macro).
* | A number of "type traits pseudo-functions" (taking one or more type
    names) are accepted: ``__has_nothrow_assign``,
    ``__has_nothrow_constructor``, ``__has_nothrow_copy``,
    ``__has_nothrow_move_assign``, ``__has_trivial_assign``,
    ``__has_trivial_constructor``, ``__has_trivial_copy``,
    ``__has_trivial_destructor``, ``__has_trivial_move_assign``,
    ``__has_trivial_move_constructor``, ``__has_virtual_destructor``,
    ``__is_abstract``, ``__is_base_of``, ``__is_class``,
    ``__is_constructible``, ``__is_convertible_to``, ``__is_destructible``,
    ``__is_empty``, ``__is_enum``, ``__is_literal_type``,
    ``__is_nothrow_assignable``, ``__is_nothrow_constructible``,
    ``__is_nothrow_destructible``, ``__is_pod``, ``__is_polymorphic``,
    ``__is_standard_layout``, ``__is_trivial``,
    ``__is_trivially_assignable``, ``__is_trivially_constructible``,
    ``__is_trivially_copyable``, ``__is_trivially_destructible``, and
    ``__is_union``.

  .. code:: c++

     double x[__is_union(union U)];  // Okay.

  | These are silently accepted even in strict modes.  They ease the
    implementation C++11 metaprogramming templates (many of which were first
    introduced by ISO/IEC TR 19768).
* | Bit fields may have base types that are ``enum``\ s or integral types
    besides ``int`` and ``unsigned int``.  This matches A.6.5.8 in the ANSI
    Common Extensions appendix.
* | If the ``ADDR_OF_BIT_FIELD_ALLOWED`` flag is TRUE, the address of a bit
    field may be taken if the bit field has the same size and alignment as one
    of the integral types.  A warning is issued.
* | The last member of a ``struct`` may have an incomplete array type.  It may
    not be the only member of the struct (otherwise, the struct would have zero
    size).
* | A file-scope array may have an incomplete ``struct``, ``union``, or
    ``enum`` type as its element type.  The type must be completed before the
    array is subscripted (if it is), and by the end of the compilation if the
    array is not ``extern``.  In C++, an incomplete ``class`` is also allowed.
* | Static functions may be declared in function and block scopes.  Their
    declarations are moved to the file scope.
* | ``enum`` tags may be incomplete: one may define the tag name and resolve it
    (by specifying the brace-enclosed list) later.
* | The values of enumeration constants may be given by expressions that
    evaluate to unsigned quantities that fit in the ``unsigned int`` range but
    not in the ``int`` range.  A warning is issued for suspicious cases.

  .. code:: c++

     /* When ints are 32 bits: */
     enum a {w = -2147483648};  /* No warning */
     enum b {x = 0x80000000};   /* No warning */
     enum c {y = 0x80000001};   /* No warning */
     enum d {z = 2147483649};   /* Warning */

* | An extra comma is allowed at the end of an ``enum`` list.  A remark is
    issued except in ``pcc`` mode.
* | The final semicolon preceding the closing ``}`` of a struct or union
    specifier may be omitted.  A warning is issued except in ``pcc`` mode.
* | A label definition may be immediately followed by a right brace.
    (Normally, a statement must follow a label definition.) A warning is
    issued.
* | An empty declaration (a semicolon with nothing before it) is allowed.  A
    remark is issued.
* | An initializer expression that is a single value and is used to initialize
    an entire static array, struct, or union need not be enclosed in braces.
    ANSI C requires the braces.
* | In an initializer, a pointer constant value may be cast to an integral type
    if the integral type is big enough to contain it.
* | The address of a variable with ``register`` storage class may be taken.  A
    warning is issued.
* | In an integral constant expression, an integer constant may be cast to a
    pointer type and then back to an integral type.
* | ``long float`` is accepted as a synonym for ``double``.
* | If ``PTR_TO_INCOMP_ARRAY_ARITHMETIC_ALLOWED`` is TRUE, pointers to
    incomplete arrays may be used in pointer addition, subtraction, and
    subscripting:

  .. code:: c++

     int (*p)[];
     ...
     q = p[0];

  | A warning is issued if the value added or subtracted is anything other than
    a constant zero.  Since the type pointed to by the pointer has zero size,
    the value added to or subtracted from the pointer is multiplied by zero and
    therefore has no effect on the result.
* | Benign redeclarations of ``typedef`` names are allowed.  That is, a typedef
    name may be redeclared in the same scope as the same type.  A warning is
    issued.
* | Dollar signs can be accepted in identifiers through use of a command line
    option or by setting a configuration parameter.  The default is to not
    allow dollar signs in identifiers.
* | Numbers are scanned according to the syntax for numbers rather than the
    ``pp-number`` syntax.  Thus, ``0x123e+1`` is scanned as three tokens
    instead of one invalid token.  (If the ``-A`` or ``-a`` option is
    specified, of course, the ``pp-number`` syntax is used.)
* | Assignment and pointer difference are allowed between pointers to types
    that are interchangeable but not identical, for example, ``unsigned char
    *`` and ``char *``.  This includes pointers to same-sized integral types
    (e.g., typically, ``int *`` and ``long *``).  A warning is issued except in
    ``pcc`` mode.  Assignment of a string constant to a pointer to any kind of
    character is allowed without a warning.
* | Assignment of pointer types is allowed in cases where the destination type
    has added type qualifiers that are not at the top level (e.g., ``int **``
    to ``const int **``).  Comparisons and pointer difference of such pairs of
    pointer types are also allowed.  A warning is issued.
* | In operations on pointers, a pointer to ``void`` is always implicitly
    converted to another type if necessary, and a null pointer constant is
    always implicitly converted to a null pointer of the right type if
    necessary.  In ANSI C, some operators allow such things, and others
    (generally, where it does not make sense) do not allow them.
* | Pointers to different function types may be assigned or compared for
    equality (``==``) or inequality (``!=``) without an explicit type cast.  A
    warning is issued.  This extension is not allowed in C++ mode.
* | A pointer to ``void`` may be implicitly converted to or from a pointer to a
    function type.
* | If the ``ATT_PREPROCESSING_EXTENSIONS_ALLOWED`` switch is TRUE, the
    ``#assert`` preprocessing extensions of AT&T System V release 4 are
    allowed.  These allow definition and testing of predicate names.  Such
    names are in a name space distinct from all other names, including macro
    names.  A predicate name is given a definition by a preprocessing directive
    of the form

      | ``#assert`` *name*
      | ``#assert`` *name*\ ``(``\ *token-sequence*\ ``)``

  | which defines the predicate *name*.  In the first form, the predicate
    is not given a value.  In the second form, it is given the value
    *token-sequence*. Such a predicate can be tested in a ``#if``
    expression, as follows:

      | ``#``\ *name*\ ``(``\ *token-sequence*\ ``)``

  | which has the value 1 if a ``#assert`` of that *name* with that
    *token-sequence* has appeared, and 0 otherwise.  A given predicate may be
    given more than one value at a given time.

  | A predicate may be deleted by a preprocessing directive of the form

      | ``#unassert`` *name*
      | ``#unassert`` *name*\ ``(``\ *token-sequence*\ ``)``

  | The first form removes all definitions of the indicated predicate name; the
    second form removes just the indicated definition, leaving any others there
    may be.
* | GNU line directive flags are accepted on ``#line`` directives.  The system
    header flag is recognized, and the associated code is treated as if found
    in a system include directory.
* | ``asm`` statements and declarations are accepted.  This is disabled in
    strict ANSI C mode (``-A`` or ``-a`` and ``-m`` options) since it conflicts
    with the ANSI C standard for something like

  .. code:: c++

     asm("xyz");

  | which ANSI C interprets as a call of an implicitly-defined function ``asm``
    and which by default the front end interprets as an ``asm`` statement.
* | When ``ASM_FUNCTION_ALLOWED`` is TRUE, ``asm`` functions are accepted, and
    ``__asm`` is recognized as a synonym for ``asm``.  An ``asm`` function body
    is represented in the IL by an uninterpreted null-terminated string
    containing the text that appears in the source (including the text of
    source comments when ``INCLUDE_COMMENTS_IN_ASM_FUNC_BODY`` is TRUE).  An
    ``asm`` function must be declared with no storage class, with a prototyped
    parameter list, and with no omitted parameters:

  .. code:: c++

       asm void f(int,int) {
         ...
       }

  | If ``asm`` functions are recognized and the C-generating back end is used,
    it is required that ANSI-C be generated, not K&R C, because the ``asm``
    function must be put out with a prototyped parameter list.
* | If ``ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_ANONYMOUS_UNIONS`` is TRUE, an extension is
    supported to allow constructs similar to C++ anonymous unions, including
    the following:

  * | not only anonymous unions but also anonymous structs are allowed -- that
      is, their members are promoted to the scope of the containing struct and
      looked up like ordinary members;
  * | they can be introduced into the containing struct by a ``typedef`` name
      -- they needn't be declared directly, as with true anonymous unions; and
  * | a tag may be declared (C mode only).

  | Among the restrictions: the extension only applies to constructs within
    structs.
* | If ``DEFAULT_ADDRESS_OF_ELLIPSIS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE, the expression ``&...``
    is accepted in the body of a function in which an ellipsis appears in the
    parameter list.  It is needed to support some versions of macro
    ``va_start`` in ``stdarg.h``.
* | If ``DEFAULT_ALLOW_ELLIPSIS_ONLY_PARAM_IN_C_MODE`` is TRUE, an ellipsis may
    appear by itself in the parameter list of a function declaration -- e.g.,
    ``f(...)``.  A diagnostic is issued in strict ANSI C mode.
* | External entities declared in other scopes are visible.  A warning is
    issued.

  .. code:: c++

     void f1(void) { extern void f(); }
     void f2() {
       f(); /* Using out of scope declaration */
     }

* | A non-lvalue array expression is converted to a pointer to the first
    element of the array when it is subscripted or similarly used.
* | The nonstandard preprocessing directive ``#include_next`` is supported.
    This is a variant of the ``#include`` directive.  It searches for the named
    file only in the directories on the search path that follow the directory
    in which the current source file (the one containing the ``#include_next``
    directive) is found.  (This is an extension found in the GNU C compiler.)
* | The nonstandard preprocessing directive ``#warning`` is supported.  It is
    similar to the ``#error`` directive, but results in a warning instead of a
    catastrophic error when processed.  This directive is not recognized in
    strict mode.  (This is an extension found in GNU C compilers.)

In the following areas considered "undefined behavior" by the ANSI C standard,
the front end does the following:

* | Adjacent wide and non-wide string literals are not concatenated unless
    ``wchar_t`` and ``char`` are the same type.  (In C++ mode, when ``wchar_t``
    is a keyword, adjacent wide and non-wide string literals are never
    concatenated.)
* | In character and string escapes, if the character following the ``\`` has
    no special meaning, the value of the escape is the character itself.  Thus
    ``"\s" == "s"``.  A warning is issued.
* | A ``struct`` that has no named fields but at least one unnamed field is
    accepted by default, but a diagnostic (a warning or error) is issued in
    strict ANSI C mode.

K&R/pcc Mode
------------

When ``pcc`` mode is specified, the front end accepts the traditional C
language defined by *The C Programming Language*, first edition, by
Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R), Prentice-Hall, 1978.  In addition, it provides
almost complete compatibility with the Reiser ``cpp`` and Johnson ``pcc``
widely used as part of UNIX systems; since there is no documentation of the
exact behavior of those programs, complete compatibility cannot be
guaranteed.

In general, when compiling in ``pcc`` mode, the front end attempts to interpret
a source program that is valid to ``pcc`` in the same way that ``pcc`` would.
However, ANSI features that do not conflict with this behavior are not
disabled.

In some cases where ``pcc`` allows a highly questionable construct, the front
end will accept it but give a warning, where ``pcc`` would be silent (for
example: ``0x``, a degenerate hexadecimal number, is accepted as zero).

The known cases where the front end is not compatible with ``pcc`` are the
following:

* | Token pasting is not done outside of macro expansions (i.e., in the primary
    source line) when two tokens are separated only by a comment.  That is,
    ``a/**/b`` is not considered to be ``ab``.  The ``pcc`` behavior in that
    case can be gotten by preprocessing to a text file and then compiling that
    file.
  |
  | The textual output from preprocessing is also equivalent but not identical:
    the blank lines and white space will not be exactly the same.
* | ``pcc`` will consider the result of a ``?:`` operator to be an lvalue if
    the first operand is constant and the second and third operands are
    compatible lvalues.  This front end will not.
* | ``pcc`` mis-parses the third operand of a ``?:`` operator in a way that
    some programs exploit:

  .. code:: c++

     i ? j : k += l

  | is parsed by ``pcc`` as

  .. code:: c++

     i ? j : (k += l)

  | which is not correct, since the precedence of ``+=`` is lower than the
    precedence of ``?:``.  This front end will generate an error for that case.
* | ``lint`` recognizes the keywords for its special comments anywhere in a
    comment, regardless of whether or not they are preceded by other text in
    the comment.  The front end only recognizes the keywords when they are the
    first identifier following an optional initial series of blanks and/or
    horizontal tabs.  ``lint`` also recognizes only a single digit of the
    ``VARARGS`` count; the front end will accumulate as many digits as appear.

The differences in ``pcc`` mode relative to the default ANSI mode are as
follows:

* | The keywords ``signed``, ``const``, and ``volatile`` are disabled, to avoid
    problems with items declared with those names in old-style code.  Those
    keywords were ANSI C inventions.  The other non-K&R keywords (``enum`` and
    ``void``) are judged to have existed already in code and are not disabled.
* | Declarations of the form

  .. code:: c++

     typedef some-type void;

  | are ignored.
* | Assignment is allowed between pointers and integers, and between
    incompatible pointer types, without an explicit cast.  A warning is issued.
* | A field selection of the form *p*\ ``->``\ *field* is allowed even if
    *p* does not point to a ``struct`` or ``union`` that contains *field*.
    *p* must be a pointer or an integer.  Likewise, *x*\ ``.``\ *field* is
    allowed even if *x* is not a ``struct`` or ``union`` that contains
    *field*.  *x* must be an lvalue.  For both cases, all definitions of
    *field* as a field must have the same offset within their ``struct`` or
    ``union``.
* | If the configuration flag ``TARG_NO_ERROR_ON_INTEGER_OVERFLOW`` is TRUE,
    overflows detected while folding signed integer operations on constants
    will cause warnings rather than errors.  Usually this should be set to
    match the desired target machine behavior on integer operations in C.
* | If the configuration flag ``SAME_REPR_INTS_INTERCHANGEABLE_IN_IL`` is TRUE,
    integral types with the same representation (size, signedness, and
    alignment) will be considered identical and may be used interchangeably.
    For example, this means that ``int`` and ``long`` will be interchangeable
    if they have the same size.
* | A warning will be issued for a ``&`` applied to an array.  The type of such
    an operation is "address of array element" rather than "address of array".
* | For the shift operators ``<<`` and ``>>``, the usual arithmetic conversions
    are done, the right operand is converted to ``int``, and the result type is
    the type of the left operand.  In ANSI C, the integral promotions are done
    on the two operands, and the result type is the type of the left operand.
    The effect of this difference is that, in ``pcc`` mode, a ``long`` shift
    count will force the shift to be done as ``long``.
* | When preprocessing output is generated, the line-identifying directives
    will have the ``pcc`` form instead of the ANSI form.
* | String literals will not be shared.  Identical string literals will cause
    multiple copies of the string to be allocated.
* | ``sizeof`` may be applied to bit fields; the size is that of the underlying
    type (e.g., ``unsigned int``).
* | lvalues cast to a type of the same size remain lvalues, except when they
    involve a floating-point conversion.
* | When a function parameter list begins with a ``typedef`` identifier, the
    parameter list is considered prototyped only if the ``typedef`` identifier
    is followed by something other than a comma or right parenthesis:

  .. code:: c++

     typedef int t;
     int f(t) {}     /* Old-style list */
     int g(t x) {}   /* Prototyped list, parameter x of type t */

  | That is, function parameters are allowed to have the same names as
    ``typedef``\ s.  In the normal ANSI mode, of course, any parameter list
    that begins with a ``typedef`` identifier is considered prototyped, so the
    first example above would give an error.
* | The names of functions and of external variables are always entered at the
    file scope.
* | A function declared ``static``, used, and never defined is treated as if
    its storage class were ``extern``.
* | A file-scope array that has an unspecified storage class and remains
    incomplete at the end of the compilation will be treated as if its storage
    class is ``extern`` (in ANSI mode, the number of elements is changed to 1,
    and the storage class remains unspecified).
* | The empty declaration

      | ``struct`` *x*;

  | will not hide an outer-scope declaration of the same tag.
* | In a declaration of a member of a ``struct`` or ``union``, no diagnostic is
    issued for omitting the declarator list; nevertheless, such a declaration
    has no effect on the layout.  For example,

  .. code:: c++

     struct s {char a; int; char b[2];} v;    /* sizeof(v) is 3 */

* | ``enum``\ s are always given type ``int``.  In ANSI mode, and depending on
    the configuration flag ``enum_types_can_be_smaller_than_int``, smaller
    integral types will be used if possible.
* | No warning is generated for a storage specifier appearing in other than the
    first position in a list of specifiers (as in ``int static``).
* | ``short``, ``long``, and ``unsigned`` are treated as "adjectives" in type
    specifiers, and they may be used to modify a ``typedef`` type.
* | A "plain" ``char`` is considered to be the same as either ``signed char``
    or ``unsigned char``, depending on the installation default and
    command-line options.  In ANSI C, "plain" ``char`` is a third type distinct
    from both ``signed char`` and ``unsigned char``.
* | Free-standing tag declarations are allowed in the parameter declaration
    list for a function with old-style parameters.
* | ``float`` function parameters are promoted to ``double`` function
    parameters.
* | ``float`` functions are promoted to ``double`` functions.
* | Declaration specifiers are allowed to be completely omitted in declarations
    (ANSI C allows this only for function declarations).  Thus

  .. code:: c++

     i;

  | declares ``i`` as an ``int`` variable. A warning is issued.
* | The ``=`` preceding an initializer may be omitted.  A warning is issued.
    See K&R first edition, Appendix A, section 17 (anachronisms).  This is
    accepted only if ``C_ANACHRONISMS_ALLOWED`` is TRUE.
* | All ``float`` operations are done as ``double``.
* | ``__STDC__`` is left undefined.
* | Extra spaces to prevent pasting of adjacent confusable tokens are not
    generated in textual preprocessing output.
* | The first directory searched for include files is the directory containing
    the file containing the ``#include`` instead of the directory containing

    if *x* is not a ``struct`` or ``union`` that contains *field*.  *x*

  .. code:: c++

     typedef unsigned int size_t;
     extern size_t strlen(const char *);
     extern int strlen();  /* Warning */

Namespace Support
=================

Namespaces are enabled by default (see ``DEFAULT_NAMESPACES_ENABLED``) except
in the cfront modes.  The command-line options ``--namespaces`` and
``--no_namespaces`` can be used to enable or disable the features.

When doing name lookup in a template instantiation, some names must be found in
the context of the template definition while others may also be found in the
context of the template instantiation.  The front end implements two different
instantiation lookup algorithms: the one mandated by the standard (referred to
as "dependent name lookup"), and the one that existed before dependent name
lookup was implemented.

Dependent name lookup is done in strict mode (unless explicitly disabled by
another command-line option) or when dependent name processing is enabled by
either a configuration flag or command-line option.

Dependent Name Processing
-------------------------

When doing dependent name lookup, the front end implements the instantiation
name lookup rules specified in the standard.  This processing requires that
nonclass prototype instantiations be done.  This in turn requires that the code
be written using the ``typename`` and ``template`` keywords as required by the
standard.

Lookup Using the Referencing Context
------------------------------------

When not using dependent name lookup, the front end uses a name lookup
algorithm that approximates the two-phase lookup rule of the standard, but does
so in such a way that is more compatible with existing code and existing
compilers.

When a name is looked up as part of a template instantiation but is not found
in the local context of the instantiation, it is looked up in a synthesized
instantiation context that includes both names from the context of the template
definition and names from the context of the instantiation.  Here's an example:

.. code:: c++

   namespace N {
     int g(int);
     int x = 0;
     template <class T> struct A {
       T f(T t) { return g(t); }
       T f() { return x; }
     };
   }
   namespace M {
     int x = 99;
     double g(double);
     N::A<int> ai;
     int i = ai.f(0);      // N::A<int>::f(int) calls N::g(int)
     int i2 = ai.f();      // N::A<int>::f() returns 0 (= N::x)
     N::A<double> ad;
     double d = ad.f(0);   // N::A<double>::f(double) calls M::g(double)
     double d2 = ad.f();   // N::A<double>::f() also returns 0 (= N::x)
   }

The lookup of names in template instantiations does not conform to the rules in
the standard in the following respects:

* | Although only names from the template definition context are considered for
    names that are not functions, the lookup is not limited to those names
    visible at the point at which the template was defined.
* | Functions from the context in which the template was referenced are
    considered for all function calls in the template.  Functions from the
    referencing context should only be visible for "dependent" function calls.

For details of the algorithm implemented, see the :ref:`symbol-table`
chapter (in particular the :ref:`instantiation-context-lookup` section).

Argument Dependent Lookup
--------------------------

When argument-dependent lookup is enabled, functions made visible using
argument-dependent lookup overload with those made visible by normal lookup.
The standard requires that this overloading occur even when the name found by
normal lookup is a block ``extern`` declaration.  The front end does this
overloading, but in default mode, argument-dependent lookup is suppressed when
the normal lookup finds a block ``extern``.

This means a program can have different behavior, depending on whether it is
compiled with or without argument-dependent lookup, even if the program makes
no use of namespaces.  For example:

.. code:: c++

   struct A { };
   A operator+(A, double);
   void f() {
     A a1;
     A operator+(A, int);
     a1 + 1.0;     // calls operator+(A, double) with arg-dependent
                   // lookup enabled but otherwise calls
                   // operator+(A, int);
   }

Runtime Support
---------------

The headers and runtime provided with the EDG front end support two different
versions (i.e., with and without namespaces) under control of
``__EDG_RUNTIME_USES_NAMESPACES``, a preprocessing option defined by the front
end.

.. _template-instantiation:

Template Instantiation
======================

The C++ language includes the concept of *templates*.  A template is a
description of a class or function that is a model for a family of related
classes or functions.  [#f3]_ For example, one can write a template for a
``Stack`` class, and then use a stack of integers, a stack of floats, and a
stack of some user-defined type.  In the source, these might be written
``Stack<int>``, ``Stack<float>``, and ``Stack<X>``.  From a single source
description of the template for a stack, the compiler can create
*instantiations* of the template for each of the types required.

The instantiation of a class template is always done as soon as it is needed in
a compilation.  However, the instantiations of template functions, template
variables, member functions of template classes, and static data members of
template classes (hereafter referred to as template entities) are not
necessarily done immediately, for several reasons:

* | One would like to end up with only one copy of each instantiated entity
    across all the object files that make up a program.  (This of course
    applies to entities with external linkage.)
* | The language allows one to write a *specialization* of a template entity,
    i.e., a specific version to be used in place of a version generated from
    the template for a specific data type.  (One could, for example, write a
    version of ``Stack<int>``, or of just ``Stack<int>::push``, that replaces
    the template-generated version; often, such a specialization provides a
    more efficient representation for a particular data type.) Since the
    compiler cannot know, when compiling a reference to a template entity, if a
    specialization for that entity will be provided in another compilation, it
    cannot do the instantiation automatically in any source file that
    references it.  (The modern C++ language requires that a specialization be
    declared in every compilation in which it is used, but for compatibility
    with existing code and older compilers the EDG front end does not require
    that in some modes.  See the command-line option
    ``--no_distinct_template_signatures``.)
* | C++ templates can be *exported* (i.e., declared with the keyword
    ``export``).  Such templates can be used in a translation unit that does
    not contain the definition of the template to instantiate.  The
    instantiation of such a template must be delayed until the template
    definition has been found.
* | The language also dictates that template functions that are not referenced
    should not be compiled, that, in fact, such functions might contain
    semantic errors that would prevent them from being compiled.  Therefore, a
    reference to a template class should not automatically instantiate all the
    member functions of that class.

(It should be noted that certain template entities are always instantiated when
used, e.g., inline functions.)

From these requirements, one can see that if the compiler is responsible for
doing all the instantiations automatically, it can only do so on a program-wide
basis.  That is, the compiler cannot make decisions about instantiation of
template entities until it has seen all the source files that make up a
complete program.

The EDG C++ front end provides an instantiation mechanism that does automatic
instantiation at link time.  For cases where the programmer wants more explicit
control over instantiation, the front end also provides instantiation modes and
instantiation pragmas, which can be used to exert fine-grained control over the
instantiation process.

Automatic Instantiation
-----------------------

The goal of an automatic instantiation mode is to provide painless
instantiation.  The programmer should be able to compile source files to object
code, then link them and run the resulting program, and never have to worry
about how the necessary instantiations get done.

In practice, this is hard for a compiler to do, and different compilers use
different automatic instantiation schemes with different strengths and
weaknesses:

* | AT&T/USL/Novell/SCO's *cfront* product saves information about each file it
    compiles in a special directory called ``ptrepository``.  It instantiates
    nothing during normal compilations.  At link time, it looks for entities
    that are referenced but not defined, and whose mangled names indicate that
    they are template entities.  For each such entity, it consults the
    ``ptrepository`` information to find the file containing the source for the
    entity, and it does a compilation of the source to generate an object file
    containing object code for that entity.  This object code for instantiated
    objects is then combined with the "normal" object code in the link step.
  |
  | The programmer using *cfront* must follow a particular coding
    convention: all templates must be declared in "``.h``" files, and for
    each such file there must be a corresponding "``.C``" file containing
    the associated definitions.  The compiler is never told about the
    "``.C``" files explicitly; one does not, for example, compile them in
    the normal way.  The link step looks for them when and if it needs
    them, and does so by taking the "``.h``" file name and replacing its
    suffix.  [#f4]_
  |
  | This scheme has the disadvantage that it does a separate compilation for
    each instantiated function (or, at best, one compilation for all the member
    functions of one class).  Even though the function itself is often quite
    small, it must be compiled along with the declarations for the types on
    which the instantiation is based, and those declarations can easily run
    into many thousands of lines.  For large systems, these compilations can
    take a very long time.  The link step tries to be smart about recompiling
    instantiations only when necessary, but because it keeps no fine-grained
    dependency information, it is often forced to "recompile the world" for a
    minor change in a "``.h``" file.  In addition, *cfront* has no way of
    ensuring that preprocessing symbols are set correctly when it does these
    instantiation compilations, if preprocessing symbols are set other than on
    the command line.
* | Borland's C++ compiler instantiates everything referenced in a compilation,
    then uses a special linker to remove duplicate definitions of instantiated
    functions.
  |
  | The programmer using Borland's compiler must make sure that every
    compilation sees all the source code it needs to instantiate all the
    template entities referenced in that compilation.  That is, one cannot
    refer to a template entity in a source file if a definition for that entity
    is not included by that source file.  In practice, this means that either
    all the definition code is put directly in the "``.h``" files, or that each
    "``.h``" file includes an associated "``.C``" (actually, "``.CPP``") file.
  |
  | This scheme is straightforward, and works well for small programs.  For
    large systems, however, it tends to produce very large object files,
    because each object file must contain object code (and symbolic debugging
    information) for each template entity it references.

EDG's approach is a little different.  It requires that, for each instantiation
of a non-exported template, there is some (normal, top-level,
explicitly-compiled) source file that contains the definition of the template
entity, a reference that causes the instantiation, and the declarations of any
types required for the instantiation.  [#f5]_ This requirement can be met in
various ways:

* | The Borland convention: each "``.h``" file that declares a template entity
    also contains either the definition of the entity or includes another file
    containing the definition.
* | Implicit inclusion: when the compiler sees a template declaration in a
    "``.h``" file and discovers a need to instantiate that entity, it is
    given permission to go off looking for an associated definition file
    having the same base name and a different suffix, and it implicitly
    includes that file at the end of the compilation.  This method allows
    most programs written using the *cfront* convention to be compiled with
    EDG's approach.  See :ref:`implicit-inclusion`.
* | The ad hoc approach: the programmer makes sure that the files that define
    template entities also have the definitions of all the available types, and
    adds code or pragmas in those files to request instantiation of the
    entities there.

Exported templates are also supported by the EDG automatic instantiation
method, but they require additional mechanisms explained further on.

The EDG automatic instantiation method works as follows for non-exported
templates: [#f6]_

#. | The first time the source files of a program are compiled, no template
     entities are instantiated.  However, template information files (with, by
     default, a "``.ti``" suffix) are generated and contain information about
     things that *could* have been instantiated in each compilation [#f7]_.
#. | When the object files are linked together, a program called the
     *prelinker* is run.  It examines the object files, looking for
     references and definitions of template entities, and for the added
     information about entities that could be instantiated.
#. | If the prelinker finds a reference to a template entity for which there
     is no definition anywhere in the set of object files, it looks for a file
     that indicates that it could instantiate that template entity.  When it
     finds such a file, it assigns the instantiation to it.  The set of
     instantiations assigned to a given file is recorded in an associated
     instantiation request file (with, by default, a "``.ii``" suffix).
#. | The prelinker then executes the compiler again to recompile each file for
     which the instantiation request file was changed.  The original
     compilation command-line options (saved in the template information file)
     are used for the recompilation.
#. | When the compiler compiles a file, it reads the instantiation request
     file for that file and obeys the requests therein.  It produces a new
     object file containing the requested template entities (and all the other
     things that were already in the object file).  The compiler also receives
     a definition list file, which lists all the instantiations for which
     definitions already exist in the set of object files.  If during the
     compilation the compiler has the opportunity to instantiate a referenced
     entity that is not on that list, it goes ahead and does the instantiation.
     It passes back to the prelinker (in the definition list file) a list of
     the instantiations that it has "adopted" in this way, so the prelinker can
     assign them to the file.  This adoption process allows rapid instantiation
     and assignment of instantiations referenced from new instantiations, and
     reduces the need to recompile a given file more than once during the
     prelinking process.
#. | The prelinker repeats steps 3-5 until there are no more instantiations to
     be adjusted.
#. | The object files are linked together.

Once the program has been linked correctly, the instantiation request files
contain a complete set of instantiation assignments.  From then on, whenever
source files are recompiled, the compiler will consult the instantiation
request files and do the indicated instantiations as it does the normal
compilations.  That means that, except in cases where the set of required
instantiations changes, the prelink step from then on will find that all the
necessary instantiations are present in the object files and no instantiation
assignment adjustments need be done.  That's true even if the entire program is
recompiled.

If the programmer provides a specialization of a template entity somewhere in
the program, the specialization will be seen as a definition by the prelinker.
Since that definition satisfies whatever references there might be to that
entity, the prelinker will see no need to request an instantiation of the
entity.  If the programmer adds a specialization to a program that has
previously been compiled, the prelinker will notice that too and remove the
assignment of the instantiation from the proper instantiation request file.

The instantiation request files should not, in general, require any manual
intervention.  One exception: if a definition is changed in such a way that
some instantiation no longer compiles (it gets errors), and at the same time a
specialization is added in another file, and the first file is being recompiled
before the specialization file and is getting errors, the instantiation request
file for the file getting the errors must be deleted manually to allow the
prelinker to regenerate it.

If the prelinker changes an instantiation assignment, it will issue a message
like

.. code:: text

   C++ prelinker: A<int>::f() assigned to file test.o
   C++ prelinker: executing: /edg/bin/eccp -c test.c

The automatic instantiation scheme can coexist with partial explicit control of
instantiation by the programmer through the use of pragmas or command-line
specification of the instantiation mode.  See the following sections.

Instantiations are normally generated as part of the object file of the
translation unit in which the instantiations are performed.  But when "one
instantiation per object" mode is specified, each instantiation is placed in
its own object file.  One-instantiation-per-object mode is useful when
generating libraries that need to include copies of the instances referenced
from the library.  If each instance is not placed in its own object file, it
may be impossible to link the library with another library containing some of
the same instances.  Without this feature it is necessary to create each
individual instantiation object file using the manual instantiation mechanism.

The automatic instantiation mode can be configured out altogether by setting
the configuration flag ``AUTOMATIC_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION`` to FALSE.  It can
be turned on or off using the ``--auto_instantiation`` and
``--no_auto_instantiation`` command-line options.  If automatic instantiation
is turned off, the template information file is not generated.

Instantiation Modes
-------------------

Normally, when a file is compiled, no template entities are instantiated
(except those assigned to the file by automatic instantiation).  The overall
instantiation mode can, however, be changed by a command line option:

.. list-table::

   * - | ``-tnone``
     - | Do not automatically create instantiations of any template entities.
         This is the default.  It is also the usually appropriate mode when
         automatic instantiation is done.
   * - | ``-tused``
     - | Instantiate those template entities that were used in the compilation.
         This will include all static data members for which there are template
         definitions.
   * - | ``-tall``
     - | Instantiate all template entities declared or referenced in the
         compilation unit.  For each fully instantiated template class, all of
         its member functions and static data members will be instantiated
         whether or not they were used.  Nonmember template functions will be
         instantiated even if the only reference was a declaration.
   * - | ``-tlocal``
     - | Similar to ``-tused`` except that the functions are given internal
         linkage.  This is intended to provide a very simple mechanism for
         those getting started with templates.  The compiler will instantiate
         the functions that are used in each compilation unit as local
         functions, and the program will link and run correctly (barring
         problems due to multiple copies of local static variables.) However,
         one may end up with many copies of the instantiated functions, so this
         is not suitable for production use.  ``-tlocal`` can not be used in
         conjunction with automatic template instantiation.  If automatic
         instantiation is enabled by default, it will be disabled by the
         ``-tlocal`` option.  If automatic instantiation is not enabled by
         default, use of ``-tlocal`` and ``-T`` is an error.

In the case where the ``eccp`` script is given a single file to compile and
link, e.g.,

.. code:: text

   eccp t.c

the compiler knows that all instantiations will have to be done in the single
source file.  Therefore, it uses the ``-tused`` mode and suppresses automatic
instantiation.

Instantiation ``#pragma`` Directives
------------------------------------

Instantiation pragmas can be used to control the instantiation of specific
template entities or sets of template entities.  There are three instantiation
pragmas:

* | The ``instantiate`` pragma causes a specified entity to be instantiated.
* | The ``do_not_instantiate`` pragma suppresses the instantiation of a
    specified entity.  It is typically used to suppress the instantiation of an
    entity for which a specific definition will be supplied.
* | The ``can_instantiate`` pragma indicates that a specified entity can be
    instantiated in the current compilation, but need not be; it is used in
    conjunction with automatic instantiation, to indicate potential sites for
    instantiation if the template entity turns out to be required.  [#f8]_

The argument to the instantiation pragma may be:

.. list-table::

   * - | a template class name
     - | ``A<int>``
   * - | a template class declaration
     - | ``class A<int>``
   * - | a member function name
     - | ``A<int>::f``
   * - | a static data member name
     - | ``A<int>::i``
   * - | a static data member decl.
     - | ``int A<int>::i``
   * - | a member function declaration
     - | ``void A<int>::f(int, char)``
   * - | a template function declaration
     - | ``char* f(int, float)``
   * - | a template variable name
     - | ``x<int>``

A pragma in which the argument is a template class name (e.g., ``A<int>`` or
``class A<int>``) is equivalent to repeating the pragma for each member
function and static data member declared in the class.  When instantiating an
entire class a given member function or static data member may be excluded
using the ``do_not_instantiate`` pragma.  For example,

.. code:: c++

   #pragma instantiate A<int>
   #pragma do_not_instantiate A<int>::f

The template definition of a template entity must be present in the compilation
for an instantiation to occur.  If an instantiation is explicitly requested by
use of the ``instantiate`` pragma and no template definition is available or a
specific definition is provided, an error is issued.

.. code:: c++

   template <class T> void f1(T);  // No body provided
   template <class T> void g1(T);  // No body provided
   void f1(int) {}  // Specific definition
   void main(){
     int i;
     double  d;
     f1(i);
     f1(d);
     g1(i);
     g1(d);
   }
   #pragma instantiate void f1(int)  // error - specific definition
   #pragma instantiate void g1(int)  // error - no body provided

``f1(double)`` and ``g1(double)`` will not be instantiated (because no bodies
were supplied) but no errors will be produced during the compilation (if no
bodies are supplied at link time, a linker error will be produced).

A member function name (e.g., ``A<int>::f``) can only be used as a pragma
argument if it refers to a single user defined member function (i.e., not an
overloaded function).  Compiler-generated functions are not considered, so a
name may refer to a user defined constructor even if a compiler-generated copy
constructor of the same name exists.  Overloaded member functions can be
instantiated by providing the complete member function declaration, as in

.. code:: c++

   #pragma instantiate char* A<int>::f(int, char*)

The argument to an instantiation pragma may not be a compiler-generated
function, an inline function, or a pure virtual function.

Implicit Inclusion
------------------

When implicit inclusion is enabled, the front end is given permission to assume
that if it needs a definition to instantiate a template entity declared in a
"``.h``" file it can implicitly include the corresponding "``.C``" file to get
the source code for the definition.  For example, if a template entity
``ABC::f`` is declared in file ``xyz.h``, and an instantiation of ``ABC::f`` is
required in a compilation but no definition of ``ABC::f`` appears in the source
code processed by the compilation, the compiler will look to see if a file
``xyz.C`` exists, and if so it will process it as if it were included at the
end of the main source file.

To find the template definition file for a given template entity the front end
needs to know the path name specified in the original include of the file in
which the template was declared and whether the file was included using the
system include syntax (e.g., ``#include <file.h>``).  This information is not
available for preprocessed source containing ``#line`` directives.
Consequently, the front end will not attempt implicit inclusion for source code
containing ``#line`` directives.

The file to be implicitly included is found by replacing the file suffix with
each of the suffixes specified in the instantiation file suffix list.  The
normal include search path mechanism is then used to look for the file to be
implicitly included.

``DEFAULT_INSTANTIATION_FILE_SUFFIX_LIST`` defines the set of definition-file
suffixes tried.  By default, the list is "``.c``", "``.C``", "``.cpp``",
"``.CPP``", "``.cxx``", "``.CXX``", and "``.cc``".

Implicit inclusion works well alongside automatic instantiation, but the two
are independent.  They can be enabled or disabled independently, and implicit
inclusion is still useful when automatic instantiation is not done.

The implicit inclusion mode can be configured out altogether by setting the
configuration flag ``INSTANTIATION_BY_IMPLICIT_INCLUSION`` to FALSE.  It can be
turned on or off using the ``--implicit_include`` and ``--no_implicit_include``
command-line option\ ``s``.

Implicit inclusions are only performed during the normal compilation of a file,
(i.e., not when doing only preprocessing).  A common means of investigating
certain kinds of problems is to produce a preprocessed source file that can be
inspected.  When using implicit inclusion it is sometimes desirable for the
preprocessed source file to include any implicitly included files.  This may be
done using the ``--no_preproc_only`` command line option.  This causes the
preprocessed output to be generated as part of a normal compilation.  When
implicit inclusion is being used, the implicitly included files will appear as
part of the preprocessed output in the precise location at which they were
included in the compilation.

Exported Templates
------------------

Exported templates are templates declared with the keyword ``export``.
Exporting a class template is equivalent to exporting each of its static data
members and each of its non-inline member functions.  An exported template is
special because its definition does not need to be present in a translation
unit that uses that template.  In other words, the definition of an exported
(non-class) template does not need to be explicitly or implicitly included in a
translation unit that instantiates that template.  For example, the following
is a valid C++ program consisting of two separate translation units:

.. code:: c++

   // File 1:
   #include <stdio.h>
   static void trace() { printf("File 1\n"); }

   export template<class T> T const& min(T const&, T const&);
   int main() {
     trace();
     return min(2, 3);
   }

.. code:: c++

   // File 2:
   #include <stdio.h>
   static void trace() { printf("File 2\n"); }

   export template<class T> T const& min(T const &a, T const &b) {
     trace();
     return a<b? a: b;
   }

Note that these two files are separate translation units: one is not included
in the other.  That allows the two functions ``trace()`` to coexist (with
internal linkage).

Support for exported templates can be enabled using the ``--export``
command-line option (it is enabled by default in strict ANSI mode; ``-A`` or
``--strict``).  For example, the program above could be built as follows using
the ``eccp`` script:

.. code:: text

   eccp --export -c file_1.c
   eccp --export -c file_2.c
   eccp file_1.o file_2.o

Finding the exported template definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The automatic instantiation of exported templates is somewhat similar (from a
user's perspective) to that of regular (included) templates.  However, an
instantiation of an exported template involves at least two translation units:
one which requires the instantiation, and one which contains the template
definition.

When a file containing definitions of exported templates is compiled, a file
with a "``.et``" suffix is created and some extra information is included in
the associated "``.ti``" file.  The "``.et``" files are used later by the front
end to find the translation unit that defines a given exported template.

When a file that potentially makes use of exported templates is compiled, the
compiler must be told where to look for "``.et``" files for exported templates
used by a given translation unit.  By default, the compiler looks in the
current directory.  Other directories may be specified with the
``--template_directory`` option.  Strictly speaking, the "``.et``" files are
only really needed when it comes time to generate an instantiation.  This means
that code using exported templates can be compiled without having the
definitions of those templates available.  Those definitions must be available
by the time prelinking is done (or when explicit instantiation is done).

The "``.et``" files only inform the front end about the location of exported
template definitions; they do not actually contain those definitions.  The
sources containing the exported template definitions must therefore be made
available at the time of instantiation (usually, when prelinking is done).  In
particular, the export facility is *not* a mechanism for avoiding the
publication of template definitions in source form.

Secondary translation units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An instantiation of an exported template can be triggered by the prelinker, by
an explicit instantiation directive, or by the ``-tused`` command-line option.
In each case, the translation unit that contains the initial point of
instantiation will be processed as the *primary translation unit*.  Based on
information it finds in the "``.et``" files, the front end will then load and
parse the translation unit containing the definition of the template to
instantiate.  This is a *secondary translation unit*.  The simultaneous
processing of the primary and secondary translation units enables the front end
to create instantiations of the exported templates (which can include entities
from both translation units).  This process may reveal the need for additional
instantiations of exported templates, which in turn can cause additional
secondary translation units to be loaded [#f9]_.

When secondary translation units are processed, the declarations they contain
are checked for consistency.  This process may report errors that would
otherwise not be caught.  Many these errors are so-called "ODR violations" (ODR
stands for "one-definition rule").  For example:

.. code:: c++

   // File 1:
   struct X {
     int x;
   };
   int main() {
     return min(2, 3);
   }

   // File 2:
   struct X {
     unsigned x;  // Error: X::x declared differently in File 1
   };
   export template<class T> T const& min(T const &a, T const &b) {
     return a<b? a: b;
   }

If there are no errors, the instantiations are generated in the output
associated with the primary translation unit (or in separate associated files
in one-instantiation-per-object mode).  This may also require that entities
with internal linkage in secondary translation units be "externalized" so they
can be accessed from the instantiations in the primary translation unit.

Libraries with exported templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Typically a (non-export) library consists of an *include* directory and a *lib*
directory.  The include directory contains the header files required by users
of the library and the lib directory contains the object code libraries that
client programs must use when linking programs.

With exported templates, users of the library must also have access to the
source code of the exported templates and the information contained in the
associated "``.et``" files.  This information should be placed in a directory
that is distributed along with the include and lib directories: This is the
*export* directory.  It must be specified using the ``--template_directory``
option when compiling client programs.

The recommended procedure to build the export directory is as follows:

#. | For each "``.et``" file in the original source directory, copy the
     associated source file to the export directory.
#. | Concatenate all of the "``.et``" files into a single "``.et``" file
     (e.g., ``mylib.et``) in the export directory.  The individual "``.et``"
     files could be copied to the export directory, but having all of the
     "``.et``" information in one file will make use of the library more
     efficient.
#. | Create an ``export_info`` file in the export directory.  The
     ``export_info`` file specifies the include search paths to be used when
     recompiling files in the export directory.  If no ``export_info`` file is
     provided, the include search path used when compiling the client program
     that uses the library will also be used to recompile the library exported
     template files.

The ``export_info`` file consists of a series of lines of the form

.. code:: text

   include=x

or

.. code:: text

   sys_include=x

where ``x`` is a path name to be placed on the include search path.  The
directories are searched in the order in which they are encountered in the
``export_info`` file.  The file can also contain comments -- which begin with a
"``#``" -- and blank lines.  Spaces are ignored but tabs are not currently
permitted.  For example:

.. code:: text

   # The include directories to be used for the xyz library
   include = /disk1/xyz/include
   sys_include = /disk2/abc/include
   include=/disk3/jkl/include

The include search path specified for a client program is ignored by the front
end when it processes the source in the export library, except when no
``export_info`` file is provided.  Command-line macro definitions specified for
a client program are also ignored by the front end when processing a source
file from the export libary; the command-line macros specified when the
corresponding "``.et``" file was produced do apply.  All other compilation
options (other than the include search path and command-line macro definitions)
used when recompiling the exported templates will be used to compile the client
program.

When a library is installed on a new system, it is likely that the
``export_info`` file will need to be adapted to reflect the location of the
required headers on that system.

Extern Inline Functions
=======================

Depending on the way in which the front end is configured, out-of-line copies
of extern inline functions are either implemented using static functions, or
are instantiated using a mechanism like the template instantiation mechanism.
Note that out-of-line copies of inline functions are only required in cases
where the function cannot be inlined, or when the address of the function is
taken (whether explicitly by the user, by implicitly generated functions, or by
compiler-generated data structures such as virtual function tables or exception
handling tables).

When static functions are used, local static variables of the functions are
promoted to global variables with specially encoded names, so that even though
there may be multiple copies of the code, there is only one copy of such global
variables.  This mechanism does not strictly conform to the standard because
the address of an extern inline function is not constant across translation
units.

When the instantiation mechanism is used, the address of an extern inline
function is constant across translation units, but at the cost of requiring the
use of one of the template instantiation mechanisms, even for programs that
don't use templates.  Definitions of extern inline functions can be provided
either through use of the automatic instantiation mechanism or by use of the
``-tused`` or ``-tall`` instantiation modes.  There is no mechanism to manually
control the definition of extern inline function bodies.

Predefined Macros
=================

The front end defines a number of preprocessing macros.  Many of them are only
defined under certain circumstances.  This section describes the macros that
are provided and the circumstances under which they are defined.  In addition,
a table of predefined macro definitions may be processed when the compiler is
invoked.  This may be used for any kind of predefined macro, but in particular
is used to define the macros that gcc and g++ define when using gcc and g++
modes.  The format of the file and other information is described in
:ref:`predefined-macro-defs`.

Pragmas
=======

``#pragma`` directives are used within the source program to request certain
kinds of special processing.  The ``#pragma`` directive is part of the standard
C and C++ languages, but the meaning of any pragma is implementation-defined.

Instantiation Pragmas
---------------------

The following are described in detail in the template instantiation section of
this chapter:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma instantiate
   #pragma do_not_instantiate
   #pragma can_instantiate

Precompiled Header Pragmas
--------------------------

The following are described in the section on precompiled header processing:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma hdrstop
   #pragma no_pch

Once Pragma
-----------

The front end also recognizes ``#pragma once``, which, when placed at the
beginning of a header file, indicates that the file is written in such a way
that including it several times has the same effect as including it once.
Thus, if the front end sees ``#pragma once`` at the start of a header file, it
will skip over it if the file is ``#include``\ d again.

A typical idiom is to place an ``#ifndef`` guard around the body of the file,
with a ``#define`` of the guard variable after the ``#ifndef``:

   | ``#pragma once           // optional``
   | ``#ifndef FILE_H``
   | ``#define FILE_H``
   | ``...`` *body of the header file* ``...``
   | ``#endif``

The ``#pragma once`` is marked as optional in this example, because the front
end recognizes the ``#ifndef`` idiom and does the optimization even in its
absence.  ``#pragma once`` is accepted for compatibility with other compilers
and to allow the programmer to use other guard-code idioms.

Diagnostic Pragmas
------------------

The following pragmas may be used to control the error severity used when a
given diagnostic message is issued.

.. code:: c++

   #pragma diag_suppress
   #pragma diag_remark
   #pragma diag_warning
   #pragma diag_error
   #pragma diag_default
   #pragma diag_once

These are similar in function to the equivalent command-line options.  Uses of
these pragmas have the following form:

   | ``#pragma diag_``\ *xxx* ``[=]`` *error_number_or_tag*\ ``,`` *error_number_or_tag* ...

The diagnostic affected is specified using either an error number or an error
tag name.  The "``=``" is optional.  Any diagnostic may be overridden to be an
error, but only diagnostics with a severity of discretionary error or below may
have their severity reduced to a warning or below, or be suppressed.  The
``diag_default`` pragma is used to return the severity of a diagnostic to the
one that was in effect before any pragmas were issued (i.e., the normal
severity of the message as modified by any command-line options).  The
following example suppresses the "pointless friend declaration" warning on the
declaration of class ``A``:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma diag_suppress 522
   class A { friend class A; };
   #pragma diag_default 522
   class B { friend class B; };

The ``diag_once`` pragma causes the specified diagnostics to be issued only
once as a warning or remark.

Pack Pragma
-----------

When ``USER_CONTROL_OF_STRUCT_PACKING`` is TRUE, ``#pragma pack`` is
recognized.  It is used to specify the maximum alignment allowed for nonstatic
data members of structs and classes, even if that alignment is less than the
alignment dictated by the member's type.

The basic syntax is:

    | ``#pragma pack(``\ *n*\ ``)``
    | ``#pragma pack()``

where argument *n*, a power-of-2 value within the range defined by
``TARG_MINIMUM_PACK_ALIGNMENT`` and ``TARG_MAXIMUM_PACK_ALIGNMENT``, is the new
packing alignment that is to go into effect for subsequent declarations, until
another ``#pragma pack`` is seen.  The second form cancels the effect of a
preceding ``#pragma pack(``\ *n*\ ``)`` and either restores the default packing
alignment specified by the ``--pack_alignment`` command-line option or, if the
option was not used, disables the packing of structs and classes.

An enhanced syntax (intended to be compatible with the similar facility offered
by Microsoft C/C++ compilers) is also supported in which keywords ``push`` and
``pop`` can be used to manage a stack of packing alignment values -- for
instance:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma pack (push, xxx, 16)
     /* Packing alignment set to 16. */
   #include "xxx.h"
   #pragma pack (pop, xxx)
     /* Packing alignment reset to what it was prior to the
        above #pragma pack directive, even if the included header
        left some unrelated pragma pack entries on the stack. */

which has the effect saving the current packing alignment value and
establishing a new one, processing the include file (which may leave the
packing alignment with an unknown setting), and restoring the original value.
Finally, the form

.. code:: c++

   #pragma pack(show)

causes the front end to emit a warning describing the current setting of the
maximum member alignment (if any).

In C++ a ``#pragma pack`` directive has "local" effect when it appears inside a
function template, an instantiation of a class template, or the body of a
member function or friend function that is defined within a class definition.
When such a context is entered, the current pack alignment state is saved, so
that it can be restored when the context is exited.  For example,

.. code:: c++

   template <class T> class A {
     :
   #pragma pack(1)
     :
   };
   #pragma pack(4)
   main() {
     A<int> a;                     // #pragma pack(1) is local to A<int>
     struct S { char c; int i; };  // sizeof(S) == 8, not 5
   }

Moreover, within an instantiation of a class or function template, the default
pack alignment is that which is in effect at the point of the template's
definition, not at the point of its instantiation.  Here is an example:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma pack(1)
   template <class T> int f(T) {
     struct S { char c; int i; };   // default pack alignment is 1 for each
     return sizeof(S);              //   instance of f<T>
   }
   #pragma pack(4)
   main() {
     int i = f(0);                  // i = 5, not 8
   }

These rules apply to inline-defined member functions, too, because their bodies
are also scanned "out of order" relative to the textual order of the source
program (i.e., not till all the class members have been declared).

.. code:: c++

   #pragma pack(4)
   struct A {
     int f() {
   #pragma pack(1)                   // #pragma pack(1) is local to A::f
       struct S { char c; int i; };  // sizeof(S) is 5
     }
     int g() {
       struct S { char c; int i; };  // sizeof(S) is 8
     }
   #pragma pack(1)
     int h() {
       struct S { char c; int i; };  // sizeof(S) is 5
     }
   };

When ``IDENT_DIRECTIVE_AND_PRAGMA`` is TRUE, ``#pragma ident`` is recognized,
as is ``#ident``:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma ident "string"
   #ident "string"

Both are implemented by recording the string in a pragma entry and passing it
to the back end.

When ``PRAGMA_WEAK_ALLOWED`` is TRUE, ``#pragma weak`` is recognized.  Its form
is:

    | ``#pragma weak`` *name1* [ ``=`` *name2* ]

where *name1* is the name to be given "weak binding" and is a synonym for
*name2* if the latter is specified.  The entire argument string is recorded
in the pragma entry and passed to the back end.

Microsoft Pragmas
-----------------

The following pragmas are accepted in Microsoft mode:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma push_macro("identifier")
   #pragma pop_macro("identifier")
   #pragma include_alias("a_long_file_name.h", "short.h")

In addition, when ``NATIVE_MULTIBYTE_CHARS_SUPPORTED_WITH_UNICODE`` is TRUE,
the ``setlocale`` pragma is accepted:

.. code:: c++

   #pragma setlocale("locale name")

The ``pack`` pragma is also accepted by the Microsoft compiler, but its
acceptance by the front end is controlled by a separate configuration flag, not
by whether or not Microsoft mode is being used.

IL Display Pragma
-----------------

As a debugging aid, in configurations where ``NEED_IL_DISPLAY`` is TRUE,
the ``il_display`` pragma can be used to display the underlying IL for the IL
entity that the pragma is attached to.  The ``il_display`` pragma is a
``pbk_next_construct`` pragma that attaches to the subsequent declaration or
statement and displays the IL associated with that entity.  Note that the IL
displayed represents the IL at the current point in the compilation and may not
accurately reflect the eventual IL.  This can be useful for displaying source
location information.  For example:

.. code:: c++

   struct A { int x, y; };
   void f(int i) {
   #pragma il_display
     A a = { 1, 2 };
   #pragma il_display
     i++;
   }

.. _precompiled-headers:

Precompiled Headers
===================

It is often desirable to avoid recompiling a set of header files,
especially when they introduce many lines of code and the primary source
files that ``#include`` them are relatively small.  The EDG front end
provides a mechanism for, in effect, taking a snapshot of the state of the
compilation at a particular point and writing it to a disk file before
completing the compilation; then, when recompiling the same source file or
compiling another file with the same set of header files, it can recognize
the "snapshot point," verify that the corresponding precompiled header
("PCH") file is reusable, and read it back in.  Under the right
circumstances, this can produce a dramatic improvement in compilation time;
the trade-off is that PCH files can take a lot of disk space.  Because of
potential memory conflicts between threads, precompiled header processing
is disabled in multi-threaded configurations.  In particular, a PCH file
cannot be created if ``MULTIPLE_THREAD_COMPILATION`` is TRUE and, because
the configurations must match, a PCH file by a single-threaded
configuration cannot be used.

Automatic Precompiled Header Processing
---------------------------------------

When ``--pch`` appears on the command line, automatic precompiled header
processing is enabled.  This means the front end will automatically look for a
qualifying precompiled header file to read in and/or will create one for use on
a subsequent compilation.

The PCH file will contain a snapshot of all the code preceding the "header
stop" point.  The header stop point is typically the first token in the primary
source file that does not belong to a preprocessing directive, but it can also
be specified directly by ``#pragma hdrstop`` (see below) if that comes first.
For example:

.. code:: c++

   #include "xxx.h"
   #include "yyy.h"
   int i;

The header stop point is ``int`` (the first non-preprocessor token) and the PCH
file will contain a snapshot reflecting the inclusion of ``xxx.h`` and
``yyy.h``.  If the first non-preprocessor token or the ``#pragma hdrstop``
appears within a ``#if`` block, the header stop point is the outermost
enclosing ``#if``.  To illustrate, here's a more complicated example:

.. code:: c++

   #include "xxx.h"
   #ifndef YYY_H
   #define YYY_H 1
   #include "yyy.h"
   #endif
   #if TEST
   int i;
   #endif

Here, the first token that does not belong to a preprocessing directive is
again ``int``, but the header stop point is the start of the ``#if`` block
containing it.  The PCH file will reflect the inclusion of ``xxx.h`` and
conditionally the definition of ``YYY_H`` and inclusion of ``yyy.h``; it will
not contain the state produced by ``#if TEST``.

A PCH file will be produced only if the header stop point and the code
preceding it (mainly, the header files themselves) meet certain requirements:

* | The header stop point must appear at file scope -- it may not be within an
    unclosed scope established by a header file.  For example, a PCH file will
    not be created in this case:

  .. code:: c++

     // xxx.h
     class A {

     // xxx.C
     #include "xxx.h"
     int i; };

* | The header stop point may not be inside a declaration started within a
    header file, nor (in C++) may it be part of a declaration list of a linkage
    specification.  For example, in the following case the header stop point is
    ``int``, but since it is not the start of a new declaration, no PCH file
    will be created:

  .. code:: c++

     // yyy.h
     static

     // yyy.C
     #include "yyy.h"
     int i;

* | Similarly, the header stop point may not be inside a ``#if`` block or a
    ``#define`` started within a header file.
* | The processing preceding the header stop must not have produced any errors.
    (Note: warnings and other diagnostics will not be reproduced when the PCH
    file is reused.)
* | No references to predefined macros ``__DATE__`` or ``__TIME__`` may have
    appeared.
* | No use of the ``#line`` preprocessing directive may have appeared.
* | ``#pragma no_pch`` (see below) must not have appeared.
* | The code preceding the header stop point must have introduced a sufficient
    number of declarations to justify the overhead associated with precompiled
    headers.  This is configurable -- see ``PCH_DECL_SEQ_THRESHOLD``.

When the host system does not support memory mapping, so that everything to be
saved in the precompiled header file is assigned to preallocated memory (i.e.,
when ``USE_MMAP_FOR_MEMORY_REGIONS`` is FALSE), two additional restrictions
apply:

* | The total memory needed at the header stop point cannot exceed the size of
    the block of preallocated memory.
* | No single program entity saved can exceed ``HOST_ALLOCATION_INCREMENT``,
    the preallocation unit.

When a precompiled header file is produced, it contains, in addition to the
snapshot of the compiler state, some information that can be checked to
determine under what circumstances it can be reused.  This includes:

* | The compiler version, including the date and time the compiler was built.
* | The current directory (i.e., the directory in which the compilation is
    occurring).
* | The command line options.
* | The initial sequence of preprocessing directives from the primary source
    file, including ``#include`` directives.
* | The date and time of the header files specified in ``#include`` directives.

This information comprises the PCH "prefix." The prefix information of a given
source file can be compared to the prefix information of a PCH file to
determine whether the latter is applicable to the current compilation.

As an illustration, consider two source files:

.. code:: c++

   // a.C
   #include "xxx.h"
   ...               // Start of code

   // b.C
   #include "xxx.h"
   ...               // Start of code

When ``a.C`` is compiled with ``--pch``, a precompiled header file named
``a.pch`` is created.  Then, when ``b.C`` is compiled (or when ``a.C`` is
recompiled), the prefix section of ``a.pch`` is read in for comparison with the
current source file.  If the command line options are identical, if ``xxx.h``
has not been modified, and so forth, then, instead of opening ``xxx.h`` and
processing it line by line, the front end reads in the rest of ``a.pch`` and
thereby establishes the state for the rest of the compilation.

It may be that more than one PCH file is applicable to a given compilation.  If
so, the largest (i.e., the one representing the most preprocessing directives
from the primary source file) is used.  For instance, consider a primary source
file that begins with:

.. code:: c++

   #include "xxx.h"
   #include "yyy.h"
   #include "zzz.h"

If there is one PCH file for ``xxx.h`` and a second for ``xxx.h`` *and*
``yyy.h``, the latter will be selected (assuming both are applicable to the
current compilation).  Moreover, after the PCH file for the first two headers
is read in and the third is compiled, a new PCH file for all three headers may
be created.

When a precompiled header file is created, it takes the name of the primary
source file, with the suffix replaced by an implementation-specified suffix
(see ``PCH_FILE_SUFFIX``, which is set to ``pch`` by default).  Unless
``--pch_dir`` is specified (see below), it is created in the directory of the
primary source file.

When a precompiled header file is created or used, a message such as

.. code:: text

   "test.C": creating precompiled header file "test.pch"

is issued.  The user may suppress the message by using the command-line option
``--no_pch_messages``.

When the ``--pch_verbose`` option is used the front end will display a message
for each precompiled header file that is considered that cannot be used giving
the reason that it cannot be used.

In automatic mode (i.e., when ``--pch`` is used) the front end will deem a
precompiled header file obsolete and delete it under the following
circumstances:

* | if the precompiled header file is based on at least one out-of-date header
    file but is otherwise applicable for the current compilation; or
* | if the precompiled header file has the same base name as the source file
    being compiled (e.g., ``xxx.pch`` and ``xxx.C``) but is not applicable for
    the current compilation (e.g., because of different command-line options).

This handles some common cases; other PCH file clean-up must be dealt with by
other means (e.g., by the user).

Support for precompiled header processing is not available when multiple source
files are specified in a single compilation: an error will be issued and the
compilation aborted if the command line includes a request for precompiled
header processing and specifies more than one primary source file.

Manual Precompiled Header Processing
------------------------------------

Command-line option ``--create_pch`` *file-name* specifies that a precompiled
header file of the specified name should be created.

Command-line option ``--use_pch`` *file-name* specifies that the indicated
precompiled header file should be used for this compilation; if it is invalid
(i.e., if its prefix does not match the prefix for the current primary source
file), a warning will be issued and the PCH file will not be used.

When either of these options is used in conjunction with ``--pch_dir``, the
indicated file name (which may be a path name) is tacked on to the directory
name, unless the file name is an absolute path name.

The ``--create_pch``, ``--use_pch``, and ``--pch`` options may not be used
together.  If more than one of these options is specified, only the last one
will apply.  Nevertheless, most of the description of automatic PCH processing
applies to one or the other of these modes -- header stop points are determined
the same way, PCH file applicability is determined the same way, and so forth.

Other Ways for Users to Control Precompiled Headers
---------------------------------------------------

There are several ways in which the user can control and/or tune how
precompiled headers are created and used.

* | ``#pragma hdrstop`` may be inserted in the primary source file at a point
    prior to the first token that does not belong to a preprocessing directive.
    It enables the user to specify where the set of header files subject to
    precompilation ends.  For example,

  .. code:: c++

     #include "xxx.h"
     #include "yyy.h"
     #pragma hdrstop
     #include "zzz.h"

  | Here, the precompiled header file will include processing state for
    ``xxx.h`` and ``yyy.h`` but not ``zzz.h``.  (This is useful if the user
    decides that the information added by what follows the ``#pragma hdrstop``
    does not justify the creation of another PCH file.)
* | ``#pragma no_pch`` may be used to suppress precompiled header processing
    for a given source file.
* | Command-line option ``--pch_dir`` *directory-name* is used to specify the
    directory in which to search for and/or create a PCH file.

Moreover, when the host system does not support memory mapping and preallocated
memory is used instead (i.e., when ``USE_MMAP_FOR_MEMORY_REGIONS`` is FALSE)
then one of the command-line options ``--pch``, ``--create_pch``, or
``--use_pch``, if it appears at all, must be the *first* option on the command
line; and in addition:

* | Command-line option ``--pch_mem`` *size* may be used to change the size
    of the preallocated block of memory from its default value.  The
    argument *size* is the number of 1024-byte units.  (``--pch_mem`` must
    also be among the first options on the command line.)

Performance Issues
------------------

The relative overhead incurred in writing out and reading back in a precompiled
header file is quite small for reasonably large header files.  (An
implementation can adjust ``PCH_DECL_SEQ_THRESHOLD`` to avoid creating
precompiled header files with too little information in them.)

In general, it doesn't cost much to write a precompiled header file out even if
it does not end up being used, and if it *is* used it almost always produces a
significant speedup in compilation.  The problem is that the precompiled header
files can be quite large (from a minimum of about 250K bytes to several
megabytes or more), and so one probably doesn't want many of them sitting
around.

Thus, despite the faster recompilations, precompiled header processing is not
likely to be justified for an arbitrary set of files with nonuniform initial
sequences of preprocessing directives.  Rather, the greatest benefit occurs
when a number of source files can share the same PCH file.  The more sharing,
the less disk space is consumed.  With sharing, the disadvantage of large
precompiled header files can be minimized, without giving up the advantage of a
significant speedup in compilation times.

Consequently, to take full advantage of header file precompilation, users
should expect to reorder the ``#include`` sections of their source files and/or
to group ``#include`` directives within a commonly used header file.

The EDG front end source provides an example of how this can be done.  A common
idiom is this:

.. code:: c++

   #include "fe_common.h"
   #pragma hdrstop
   #include ...

where ``fe_common.h`` pulls in, directly and indirectly, a few dozen header
files; the ``#pragma hdrstop`` is inserted to get better sharing with fewer PCH
files.  The PCH file produced for ``fe_common.h`` is a bit over a megabyte in
size.  Another idiom, used by the source files involved in declaration
processing, is this:

.. code:: c++

   #include "fe_common.h"
   #include "decl_hdrs.h"
   #pragma hdrstop
   #include ...

``decl_hdrs.h`` pulls in another dozen header files, and a second, somewhat
larger, PCH file is created.  In all, the fifty-odd source files of the EDG
front end share just six precompiled header files.  If disk space were at a
premium, one could decide to make ``fe_common.h`` pull in *all* the header
files used -- then, a single PCH file could be used in building the EDG
front end.

Different environments and different projects will have different needs, but in
general, users should be aware that making the best use of the precompiled
header support will require some experimentation and probably some minor
changes to source code.

.. [#f1] This is not recommended in general, since diagnostic messages and the
         like will then not include a file name or will refer to the file name
         "``-``".
.. [#f2] However, if ``STACK_REFERENCED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` is TRUE, the
         directories of all the source input files currently in use are
         searched, in reverse order of ``#include`` nesting.
.. [#f3] Since templates are descriptions of entities (typically, classes)
         that are parameterizable according to the types they operate upon,
         they are sometimes called *parameterized types*.
.. [#f4] The actual implementation allows for several different suffixes and
         provides a command-line option to change the suffixes sought.
.. [#f5] Isn't this always the case? No.  Suppose that file A contains a
         definition of class ``X`` and a reference to ``Stack<X>::push``, and
         that file B contains the definition for the member function ``push``.
         There would be no file containing both the definition of ``push`` and
         the definition of ``X``.
.. [#f6] It should be noted that automatic instantiation, more than most
         aspects of the C++ language, requires environmental support outside
         of the compiler.  This is likely to be operating-system and
         object-format dependent.  The front end is delivered with an
         implementation that works under certain UNIX systems, and that
         involves code in the front end proper, in IL lowering, in a separate
         prelinker program, and in the ``eccp`` driver script.  Because the
         environmental issues vary so much from system to system, this code
         should be viewed as a sample implementation that may need adaptation
         to work on other systems.
.. [#f7] As a configuration option, and in older versions of the front end,
         the information about entities that could be instantiated, etc.  can
         be represented in the names of generated variables added to the object
         program.  For example, a name ``__CBI__``\ *mangled-name* indicates
         that the entity with the given mangled name could be instantiated, but
         wasn't.  This alternate scheme has the advantage that the object file
         and the asssociated instantiation flags can never be out of sync.  It
         has the disadvantage that the object files produced can be quite a bit
         larger because of the name strings for these generated external
         variables.
.. [#f8] At the moment, the ``can_instantiate`` pragma ends up forcing the
         instantiation of the template instance even if it isn't referenced
         somewhere else in the program; that's a weakness of the initial
         implementation which we expect to address.
.. [#f9] As a consequence, using exported templates may require considerably
         more memory that similar uses of regular (included) templates.
